* VictoriaLogs - the log database, it accepts the data from `telegraf` by elastic protocol
* VictoriaMetrics - collects metrics from `VictoriaLogs` and `VictoriaMetrics`

* for querying the data via command-line please check [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#command-line)
