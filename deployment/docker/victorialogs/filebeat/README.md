* VictoriaLogs - the log database, it accepts the data from `filebeat` by elastic protocol
* VictoriaMetrics - collects metrics from `filebeat` via `filebeat-exporter`, `VictoriaLogs` and `VictoriaMetrics`

Querying the data 

* [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#vmui) - a web UI is accessible by `http://localhost:9428/select/vmui`
* for querying the data via command-line please check [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#command-line)

the example of [filebeat configuration](./syslog./filebeat.yml)
