## VictoriaMetrics - the best long-term remote storage for Prometheus

[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest)

### VictoriaMetrics features

- Native [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) support. Additionally, VictoriaMetrics extends PromQL with useful features. See [Extended PromQL](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/wiki/ExtendedPromQL) for more details.
- Simple configuration. Just copy-n-paste remote storage URL to Prometheus config and that's it! See [Quick Start](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/wiki/Quick-Start) for more info.
- Reduced operational overhead. Offload operational burden - configuration, capacity planning, scalability, backups, retention, durability - from Prometheus local storage to VictoriaMetrics.
- Insertion rate scales to [millions of metric values per second](https://medium.com/@valyala/insert-benchmarks-with-inch-influxdb-vs-victoriametrics-e31a41ae2893).
- Storage scales to [millions of metrics](https://medium.com/@valyala/high-cardinality-tsdb-benchmarks-victoriametrics-vs-timescaledb-vs-influxdb-13e6ee64dd6b) with trillions of metric values.
- Wide range of retention periods - from 1 month to 5 years. Users may create different projects (aka `storage namespaces`) with different retention periods.
- [Fast query engine](https://medium.com/@valyala/when-size-matters-benchmarking-victoriametrics-vs-timescale-and-influxdb-6035811952d4). It excels on heavy queries over thousands of metrics with millions of metric values.
- The same remote storage URL may be used by multiple Prometheus instances collecting distinct metric sets, so all these metrics may be used in a single query (aka `global querying view`). This works ideally for multiple Prometheus instances located in different subnetworks / datacenters.
- Accepts data in [InfluxDB line protocol](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/), so [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) and other influx-compatible agents may send data to VictoriaMetrics.
- [Single-server VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases) accepts data in [Graphite plaintext protocol](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-plaintext-protocol) if `-graphiteListenAddr` is set and in [OpenTSDB format](http://opentsdb.net/docs/build/html/api_telnet/put.html) if `-opentsdbListenAddr` is set.
- VictoriaMetrics supports backfilling, i.e. data points from the past may be inserted into the DB.
- Time series data may be exported via `/api/v1/export?match=<metric_selector>`. Optional `start` and `end` timestamps may be added for exporting time series in the given time range.
- Time series may be deleted via `/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series?match[]=<metric_selector>`.
- [Instant snapshots](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282) are supported.
