If you have performance issues with `consul_sd_configs` on a large cluster, then consider using [consulagent_sd_configs](#consulagent_sd_configs) instead.

## consulagent_sd_configs

Consul Agent SD configuration allows retrieving scrape targets from [Consul Agent API](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/api-docs/agent/service).
When using the Agent API, only services registered in the locally running Consul Agent are discovered.
It is suitable for huge clusters for which using the [Catalog API](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/api-docs/catalog#list-services) would be too slow or resource intensive,
in other cases it is recommended to use [consul_sd_configs](#consul_sd_configs).

Configuration example:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: consulagent
  consulagent_sd_configs:

    # server is an optional Consul Agent to connect to. By default, localhost:8500 is used
  - server: "localhost:8500"

    # token is an optional Consul API token.
    # If the token isn't specified, then it is read from a file pointed by CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN_FILE
    # environment var or from the CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN environment var.
    # token: "..."

    # datacenter is an optional Consul API datacenter.
    # If the datacenter isn't specified, then it is read from Consul server.
    # See https://www.consul.io/api-docs/agent#read-configuration
    # datacenter: "..."

    # namespace is an optional Consul namespace.
    # See https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/enterprise/namespaces
    # If the namespace isn't specified, then it is read from CONSUL_NAMESPACE environment var.
    # namespace: "..."

    # scheme is an optional scheme (http or https) to use for connecting to Consul server.
    # By default, http scheme is used.
    # scheme: "..."

    # services is an optional list of services for which targets are retrieved.
    # If omitted, all services are scraped.
    # See https://www.consul.io/api-docs/catalog#list-nodes-for-service .
    # services: ["...", "..."]

    # tag_separator is an optional string by which Consul tags are joined into the __meta_consul_tags label.
    # By default, "," is used as a tag separator.
    # Individual tags are also available via __meta_consul_tag_<tagname> labels - see below.
    # tag_separator: "..."

    # filter is optional filter for service nodes discovery request.
    # Replaces tags and node_metadata options.
    # consul supports it since 1.14 version
    # list of supported filters https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/api-docs/catalog#filtering-1
    # syntax examples https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/api-docs/features/filtering

## dns_sd_configs

DNS-based service discovery allows retrieving scrape targets from the specified DNS domain names.
These specified names are periodically queried to discover a list of targets with the interval
configured via `-promscrape.dnsSDCheckInterval` command-line flag.

Configuration example:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: dns
  dns_sd_configs:
    # names must contain a list of DNS names to query.
  - names: ["...", "..."]

    # type is an optional type of DNS query to perform.
    # Supported values are: SRV, A, AAAA or MX.
    # By default, SRV is used.
    # type: ...

    # port is a port number to use if the query type is not SRV.
    # port: ...
```

Each discovered target has an [`__address__`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/relabeling.html#how-to-modify-scrape-urls-in-targets) label set
to the `<addr>:<port>`, where `<addr>` is the discovered DNS address, while `<port>` is either the discovered port for SRV records or the port
specified in the `dns_sd_config`.

The following meta labels are available on discovered targets during [relabeling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#relabeling):

## http_sd_configs

HTTP-based service discovery fetches targets from the specified `url`.

Configuration example:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: http
  http_sd_configs:
    # url must contain the URL from which the targets are fetched.
  - url: "http://..."

    # Additional HTTP API client options can be specified here.
    # See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#http-api-client-options
```

The service at `url` must return JSON response in the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "targets": [ "<host>", ... ],
    "labels": {
      "<labelname>": "<labelvalue>",
      ...
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

The `url` is queried periodically with the interval specified in `-promscrape.httpSDCheckInterval` command-line flag.
Discovery errors are tracked in `promscrape_discovery_http_errors_total` metric.

Each discovered target has an [`__address__`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/relabeling.html#how-to-modify-scrape-urls-in-targets) label set
to one of the targets returned by the http service.

  of `NodeInternalIP`, `NodeExternalIP`, `NodeLegacyHostIP` and `NodeHostName`,
  while `<port>` is the kubelet port on the given node.

  Available meta labels for `role: node` during [relabeling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#relabeling):

  Each discovered target has an [`__address__`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/relabeling.html#how-to-modify-scrape-urls-in-targets) label set
  to `<service_name>.<namespace>:<port>`, where `<service_name>` is the service name, `<namespace>` is the service namespace
  and `<port>` is the service port.
  If the service has multiple ports, then multiple targets are discovered for the service - one per each port.

  This is generally useful for blackbox monitoring of a service. The target address will be set to the Kubernetes DNS name
  of the service and respective service port.

  Available meta labels for `role: service` during [relabeling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#relabeling):

* `role: ingress`

  The `role: ingress` discovers a target for each path of each ingress.

  Each discovered target has an [`__address__`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/relabeling.html#how-to-modify-scrape-urls-in-targets) label set
  to the host obtained from ingress spec.
  If the ingress has multiple specs with multiple hosts, then a target per each host is created.

  This is generally useful for blackbox monitoring of an ingress.

  Available meta labels for `role: ingress` during [relabeling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#relabeling):

  * `__meta_kubernetes_namespace`: The namespace of the ingress object.
  * `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_name`: The name of the ingress object.
  * `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_label_<labelname>`: Each label from the ingress object.
  * `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_labelpresent_<labelname>`: "true" for each label from the ingress object.
  * `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_annotation_<annotationname>`: Each annotation from the ingress object.
  * `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_annotationpresent_<annotationname>`: "true" for each annotation from the ingress object.
  * `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_class_name`: Class name from ingress spec, if present.
  * `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_scheme`: Protocol scheme of ingress, https if TLS config is set. Defaults to http.
  * `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_path`: Path from ingress spec. Defaults to `/`.

## kuma_sd_configs

Kuma service discovery config allows to fetch targets from the specified control plane `server` of [Kuma Service Mesh](https://kuma.io).

It discovers "monitoring assignments" based on Kuma Dataplane Proxies, 
via the [MADS (Monitoring Assignment Discovery Service)](https://kuma.io/docs/2.1.x/policies/traffic-metrics/#traffic-metrics) 
[xDS RESP API](http://envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-docs/xds_protocol).

Configuration example:

```yaml
scrape_configs:

    # Additional HTTP API client options can be specified here.
    # See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#http-api-client-options
```

The `server` is queried periodically with the interval specified in `-promscrape.kumaSDCheckInterval` command-line flag.
Discovery errors are tracked in `promscrape_discovery_kuma_errors_total` metric.

Each discovered target has an [`__address__`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/relabeling.html#how-to-modify-scrape-urls-in-targets) label set
to one of the targets returned by the http service.

The following meta labels are available on discovered targets during [relabeling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#relabeling):
