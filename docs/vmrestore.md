# vmrestore

`vmrestore` restores data from backups created by [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup.html).

Restore process can be interrupted at any time. It is automatically resumed from the interruption point
when restarting `vmrestore` with the same args.

## Usage

VictoriaMetrics must be stopped during the restore process.

Run the following command to restore backup from the given `-src` into the given `-storageDataPath`:

```console
./vmrestore -src=<storageType>://<path/to/backup> -storageDataPath=<local/path/to/restore>
```

* `<storageType>://<path/to/backup>` is the path to backup made with [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup.html).
  `vmrestore` can restore backups from the following storage types:
  * [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/). Example: `-src=gs://<bucket>/<path/to/backup>`
  * [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Example: `-src=s3://<bucket>/<path/to/backup>`
  * [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/). Example: `-src=azblob://<container>/<path/to/backup>`
  * Any S3-compatible storage such as [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio), [Ceph](https://docs.ceph.com/en/pacific/radosgw/s3/)
    or [Swift](https://platform.swiftstack.com/docs/admin/middleware/s3_middleware.html). See [these docs](#advanced-usage) for details.
  * Local filesystem. Example: `-src=fs://</absolute/path/to/backup>`. Note that `vmbackup` prevents from storing the backup
    into the directory pointed by `-storageDataPath` command-line flag, since this directory should be managed solely by VictoriaMetrics or `vmstorage`.
* `<local/path/to/restore>` is the path to folder where data will be restored. This folder must be passed
  to VictoriaMetrics in `-storageDataPath` command-line flag after the restore process is complete.

The original `-storageDataPath` directory may contain old files. They will be substituted by the files from backup,
i.e. the end result would be similar to [rsync --delete](https://askubuntu.com/questions/476041/how-do-i-make-rsync-delete-files-that-have-been-deleted-from-the-source-folder).


## Troubleshooting

* If `vmrestore` eats all the network bandwidth, then set `-maxBytesPerSecond` to the desired value.
* If `vmrestore` has been interrupted due to temporary error, then just restart it with the same args. It will resume the restore process.

## Advanced usage

* Obtaining credentials from a file.

  Add flag `-credsFilePath=/etc/credentials` with following content:

    for s3 (aws, minio or other s3 compatible storages):

     ```console
     [default]
     aws_access_key_id=theaccesskey
     aws_secret_access_key=thesecretaccesskeyvalue
    ```

    for gce cloud storage:

    ```json
    {
           "type": "service_account",
           "project_id": "project-id",
           "private_key_id": "key-id",
           "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nprivate-key\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
           "client_email": "service-account-email",
           "client_id": "client-id",
           "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
           "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
           "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
           "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/service-account-email"
    }
    ```

* Usage with s3 custom url endpoint.  It is possible to use `vmrestore` with s3 api compatible storages, like  minio, cloudian and other.
  You have to add custom url endpoint with a flag:

```console
  # for minio:
  -customS3Endpoint=http://localhost:9000

  # for aws gov region
  -customS3Endpoint=https://s3-fips.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com
```

* Run `vmrestore -help` in order to see all the available options:

```console
  -concurrency int
     The number of concurrent workers. Higher concurrency may reduce restore duration (default 10)
  -configFilePath string
     Path to file with S3 configs. Configs are loaded from default location if not set.
     See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html
  -configProfile string
     Profile name for S3 configs. If no set, the value of the environment variable will be loaded (AWS_PROFILE or AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE), or if both not set, DefaultSharedConfigProfile is used
  -credsFilePath string
     Path to file with GCS or S3 credentials. Credentials are loaded from default locations if not set.
     See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html
  -customS3Endpoint string
     Custom S3 endpoint for use with S3-compatible storages (e.g. MinIO). S3 is used if not set
  -deleteAllObjectVersions
     Whether to prune previous object versions when deleting an object. By default, when object storage has versioning enabled deleting the file removes only current version. This option forces removal of all previous versions. See: https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup.html#permanent-deletion-of-objects-in-s3-compatible-storages
  -enableTCP6
     Whether to enable IPv6 for listening and dialing. By default, only IPv4 TCP and UDP are used
  -envflag.enable
     Whether to enable reading flags from environment variables in addition to the command line. Command line flag values have priority over values from environment vars. Flags are read only from the command line if this flag isn't set. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#environment-variables for more details
  -envflag.prefix string
     Prefix for environment variables if -envflag.enable is set
  -eula

  -flagsAuthKey string
     Auth key for /flags endpoint. It must be passed via authKey query arg. It overrides httpAuth.* settings
  -fs.disableMmap
     Whether to use pread() instead of mmap() for reading data files. By default, mmap() is used for 64-bit arches and pread() is used for 32-bit arches, since they cannot read data files bigger than 2^32 bytes in memory. mmap() is usually faster for reading small data chunks than pread()
  -http.connTimeout duration
     Incoming http connections are closed after the configured timeout. This may help to spread the incoming load among a cluster of services behind a load balancer. Please note that the real timeout may be bigger by up to 10% as a protection against the thundering herd problem (default 2m0s)

     The maximum duration for a graceful shutdown of the HTTP server. A highly loaded server may require increased value for a graceful shutdown (default 7s)
  -http.pathPrefix string
     An optional prefix to add to all the paths handled by http server. For example, if '-http.pathPrefix=/foo/bar' is set, then all the http requests will be handled on '/foo/bar/*' paths. This may be useful for proxied requests. See https://www.robustperception.io/using-external-urls-and-proxies-with-prometheus
  -http.shutdownDelay duration
     Optional delay before http server shutdown. During this delay, the server returns non-OK responses from /health page, so load balancers can route new requests to other servers
  -httpAuth.password string
     Password for HTTP server's Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if -httpAuth.username is empty
  -httpAuth.username string
     Username for HTTP server's Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if empty. See also -httpAuth.password
  -httpListenAddr string
     TCP address for exporting metrics at /metrics page (default ":8421")
  -internStringCacheExpireDuration duration
     The expiry duration for caches for interned strings. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning . See also -internStringMaxLen and -internStringDisableCache (default 6m0s)
  -internStringDisableCache

## How to build from sources

It is recommended using [binary releases](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest) - see `vmutils-*` archives there.

### Development build

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install). The minimum supported version is Go 1.20.
1. Run `make vmrestore` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds `vmrestore` binary and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Production build

1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
1. Run `make vmrestore-prod` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds `vmrestore-prod` binary and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Building docker images

Run `make package-vmrestore`. It builds `victoriametrics/vmrestore:<PKG_TAG>` docker image locally.
`<PKG_TAG>` is auto-generated image tag, which depends on source code in the repository.
The `<PKG_TAG>` may be manually set via `PKG_TAG=foobar make package-vmrestore`.

The base docker image is [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) but it is possible to use any other base image
by setting it via `<ROOT_IMAGE>` environment variable. For example, the following command builds the image on top of [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) image:

```console
ROOT_IMAGE=scratch make package-vmrestore
```
