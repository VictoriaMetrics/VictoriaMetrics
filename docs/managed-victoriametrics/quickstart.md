# Quick Start

Managed VictoriaMetrics – is a database-as-a-service platform, where users can run the VictoriaMetrics 
that they know and love on AWS without the need to perform typical DevOps tasks such as proper configuration, 
monitoring, logs collection, access protection, software updates, backups, etc.

## Creating deployments

On the [Deployments](https://cloud.victoriametrics.com/deployments?utm_source=website&utm_campaign=docs_quickstart) page you 
will see a list of your existing deployments and will be able to manage them. 

To create a deployment click on the button `Create Deployment` button:


  <img src="create_deployment_start.webp" >


On the opened screen, choose parameters of your new deployment:

* `Deployment type` 
  * Single - for affordable, performant single-node deployments;
  * Cluster - for highly available and multi-tenant deployments;
* `Region` – AWS region where deployment will run;
* Desired `storage capacity` for storing metrics (you always can expand disk size later);
* `Retention` period for stored metrics.
* `Size` of your deployment [based on your needs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/guides/understand-your-setup-size.html)


  <img src="create_deployment_form.webp" >


When all parameters are configured, click on the `Create` button, and deployment will be created.

Once created, deployment will remain for a short period of time in `PROVISIONING` status 
while the hardware spins-up, just wait for a couple of minutes and reload the page. 
You'll also be notified via email once your deployment is ready to use:


  <img src="create_deployment_created.webp" >



  <img src="create_deployment_active_email.webp" >


## Start writing and reading data

After transition from `PROVISIONING` to `RUNNING` state, Managed VictoriaMetrics deployment is fully operational 
and is ready to accept write and read requests. 

Click on deployment name and navigate to the Access tab to get the access token:


  <img src="deployment_access.webp" >


Access tokens are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access the VictoriaMetrics API. 
Supported token types are `Read-Only`, `Write-Only` and `Read-Write`. Click on token created by default 
to see usage examples:


  <img src="deployment_access_write_example.webp" >



  <img src="deployment_access_read_example.webp" >


Follow usage examples in order to configure access to VictoriaMetrics for your Prometheus, 
Grafana or any other software.

## Modifying an existing deployment

Remember, you can always add, remove or modify existing deployment by changing its size or any parameters on the 
deployment's page. 
It is important to know that downgrade for cluster is currently not available.


  <img src="modify_deployment.webp" >

 
To discover additional configuration options click on `Advanced Settings` button, so you should see the following:


  <img src="modify_deployment_additional_settings.webp" >


In that section, additional params can be set:

* [`Deduplication`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#deduplication) defines interval when deployment leaves a single raw sample with the biggest timestamp per each discrete interval;
* `Maintenance Window` when deployment should start an upgrade process if needed;
* `Settings` allow to define different flags for the deployment:

   1. [cluster components flags](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#list-of-command-line-flags).
   2. [single version flags](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#list-of-command-line-flags).

Please note, such an update requires a deployment restart and may result in a short downtime for single-node deployments.
