## Documentation of Helm Chart

Generate docs with ``helm-docs`` command.

```bash
cd charts/crds

helm-docs
```

The markdown generation is entirely go template driven. The tool parses metadata from charts and generates a number of sub-templates that can be referenced in a template file (by default ``README.md.gotmpl``). If no template file is provided, the tool has a default internal template that will generate a reasonably formatted README.
