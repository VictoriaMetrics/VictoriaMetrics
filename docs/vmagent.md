# vmagent

`vmagent` is a tiny agent which helps you collect metrics from various sources,
[relabel and filter the collected metrics](#relabeling)
and store them in [VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics)
or any other storage systems via Prometheus `remote_write` protocol.

See [Quick Start](#quick-start) for details.

<img alt="vmagent" src="vmagent.png">

## Motivation

While VictoriaMetrics provides an efficient solution to store and observe metrics, our users needed something fast
and RAM friendly to scrape metrics from Prometheus-compatible exporters into VictoriaMetrics.
Also, we found that our user's infrastructure are like snowflakes in that no two are alike. Therefore, we decided to add more flexibility
to `vmagent` such as the ability to [accept metrics via popular push protocols](#how-to-push-data-to-vmagent)
additionally to [discovering Prometheus-compatible targets and scraping metrics from them](#how-to-collect-metrics-in-prometheus-format).

## Features

* Can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus for discovering and scraping targets such as [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter).
  Note that single-node VictoriaMetrics can also discover and scrape Prometheus-compatible targets in the same way as `vmagent` does -
  see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-scrape-prometheus-exporters-such-as-node-exporter).
* Can add, remove and modify labels (aka tags) via Prometheus relabeling. Can filter data before sending it to remote storage. See [these docs](#relabeling) for details.
* Can accept data via all the ingestion protocols supported by VictoriaMetrics - see [these docs](#how-to-push-data-to-vmagent).
* Can aggregate incoming samples by time and by labels before sending them to remote storage - see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation.html).
* Can replicate collected metrics simultaneously to multiple Prometheus-compatible remote storage systems - see [these docs](#replication-and-high-availability).
* Can save egress network bandwidth usage costs when [VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol](#victoriametrics-remote-write-protocol)
  is used for sending the data to VictoriaMetrics.
* Works smoothly in environments with unstable connections to remote storage. If the remote storage is unavailable, the collected metrics
  are buffered at `-remoteWrite.tmpDataPath`. The buffered metrics are sent to remote storage as soon as the connection
  to the remote storage is repaired. The maximum disk usage for the buffer can be limited with `-remoteWrite.maxDiskUsagePerURL`.
* Uses lower amounts of RAM, CPU, disk IO and network bandwidth than Prometheus.
* Scrape targets can be spread among multiple `vmagent` instances when big number of targets must be scraped. See [these docs](#scraping-big-number-of-targets).
* Can load scrape configs from multiple files. See [these docs](#loading-scrape-configs-from-multiple-files).
* Can efficiently scrape targets that expose millions of time series such as [/federate endpoint in Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/).
  See [these docs](#stream-parsing-mode).
* Can deal with [high cardinality](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-high-cardinality)
  and [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-high-churn-rate) issues by limiting the number of unique time series at scrape time
  and before sending them to remote storage systems. See [these docs](#cardinality-limiter).
* Can write collected metrics to multiple tenants. See [these docs](#multitenancy).
* Can read data from Kafka. See [these docs](#reading-metrics-from-kafka).
* Can write data to Kafka. See [these docs](#writing-metrics-to-kafka).

## Quick Start

Please download `vmutils-*` archive from [releases page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases) (
`vmagent` is also available in [docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/vmagent/tags)),
unpack it and pass the following flags to the `vmagent` binary in order to start scraping Prometheus-compatible targets
and sending the data to the Prometheus-compatible remote storage:

* `-promscrape.config` with the path to [Prometheus config file](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html) (usually located at `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`).
  The path can point either to local file or to http url. `vmagent` doesn't support some sections of Prometheus config file,
  so you may need either to delete these sections or to run `vmagent` with `-promscrape.config.strictParse=false` command-line flag.
  In this case `vmagent` ignores unsupported sections. See [the list of unsupported sections](#unsupported-prometheus-config-sections).
* `-remoteWrite.url` with Prometheus-compatible remote storage endpoint such as VictoriaMetrics, where to send the data to.

Example command for writing the data received via [supported push-based protocols](#how-to-push-data-to-vmagent)
to [single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) located at `victoria-metrics-host:8428`:

```console
/path/to/vmagent -remoteWrite.url=https://victoria-metrics-host:8428/api/v1/write
```

See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#url-format) if you need writing
the data to [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html).

Example command for scraping Prometheus targets and writing the data to single-node VictoriaMetrics:

```console
/path/to/vmagent -promscrape.config=/path/to/prometheus.yml -remoteWrite.url=https://victoria-metrics-host:8428/api/v1/write
```

See [how to scrape Prometheus-compatible targets](#how-to-collect-metrics-in-prometheus-format) for more details.

If you use single-node VictoriaMetrics, then you can discover and scrape Prometheus-compatible targets directly from VictoriaMetrics
without the need to use `vmagent` - see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-scrape-prometheus-exporters-such-as-node-exporter).

`vmagent` can save network bandwidth usage costs under high load when [VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol is used](#victoriametrics-remote-write-protocol).

See [troubleshooting docs](#troubleshooting) if you encounter common issues with `vmagent`.

See [various use cases](#use-cases) for vmagent.

Pass `-help` to `vmagent` in order to see [the full list of supported command-line flags with their descriptions](#advanced-usage).

## How to push data to vmagent

`vmagent` supports [the same set of push-based data ingestion protocols as VictoriaMetrics does](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-import-time-series-data)
additionally to pull-based Prometheus-compatible targets' scraping:

* DataDog "submit metrics" API. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-send-data-from-datadog-agent).
* InfluxDB line protocol via `http://<vmagent>:8429/write`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-send-data-from-influxdb-compatible-agents-such-as-telegraf).
* Graphite plaintext protocol if `-graphiteListenAddr` command-line flag is set. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-send-data-from-graphite-compatible-agents-such-as-statsd).
* OpenTelemetry http API. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#sending-data-via-opentelemetry).
* OpenTSDB telnet and http protocols if `-opentsdbListenAddr` command-line flag is set. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-send-data-from-opentsdb-compatible-agents).
* Prometheus remote write protocol via `http://<vmagent>:8429/api/v1/write`.
* JSON lines import protocol via `http://<vmagent>:8429/api/v1/import`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-import-data-in-json-line-format).
* Native data import protocol via `http://<vmagent>:8429/api/v1/import/native`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-import-data-in-native-format).
* Prometheus exposition format via `http://<vmagent>:8429/api/v1/import/prometheus`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-import-data-in-prometheus-exposition-format) for details.
* Arbitrary CSV data via `http://<vmagent>:8429/api/v1/import/csv`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-import-csv-data).

## Configuration update

`vmagent` should be restarted in order to update config options set via command-line args.
`vmagent` supports multiple approaches for reloading configs from updated config files such as
`-promscrape.config`, `-remoteWrite.relabelConfig`, `-remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig` and `-remoteWrite.streamAggr.config`:

* Sending `SIGHUP` signal to `vmagent` process:

  ```console
  kill -SIGHUP `pidof vmagent`
  ```

* Sending HTTP request to `http://vmagent:8429/-/reload` endpoint.

There is also `-promscrape.configCheckInterval` command-line option, which can be used for automatic reloading configs from updated `-promscrape.config` file.

## Use cases

### IoT and Edge monitoring

`vmagent` can run and collect metrics in IoT environments and industrial networks with unreliable or scheduled connections to their remote storage.
It buffers the collected data in local files until the connection to remote storage becomes available and then sends the buffered
data to the remote storage. It re-tries sending the data to remote storage until errors are resolved.
The maximum on-disk size for the buffered metrics can be limited with `-remoteWrite.maxDiskUsagePerURL`.

`vmagent` works on various architectures from the IoT world - 32-bit arm, 64-bit arm, ppc64, 386, amd64.

The `vmagent` can save network bandwidth usage costs by using [VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol](#victoriametrics-remote-write-protocol).

### Drop-in replacement for Prometheus

If you use Prometheus only for scraping metrics from various targets and forwarding these metrics to remote storage
then `vmagent` can replace Prometheus. Typically, `vmagent` requires lower amounts of RAM, CPU and network bandwidth compared with Prometheus.
See [these docs](#how-to-collect-metrics-in-prometheus-format) for details.

### Statsd alternative

`vmagent` can be used as an alternative to [statsd](https://github.com/statsd/statsd)
when [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation.html) is enabled.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation.html#statsd-alternative) for details.

### Flexible metrics relay

`vmagent` can accept metrics in [various popular data ingestion protocols](#how-to-push-data-to-vmagent), apply [relabeling](#relabeling)
to the accepted metrics (for example, change metric names/labels or drop unneeded metrics) and then forward the relabeled metrics
to other remote storage systems, which support Prometheus `remote_write` protocol (including other `vmagent` instances).

### Replication and high availability

`vmagent` replicates the collected metrics among multiple remote storage instances configured via `-remoteWrite.url` args.
If a single remote storage instance temporarily is out of service, then the collected data remains available in another remote storage instance.
`vmagent` buffers the collected data in files at `-remoteWrite.tmpDataPath` until the remote storage becomes available again,
and then it sends the buffered data to the remote storage in order to prevent data gaps.

[VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html) already supports replication,
so there is no need in specifying multiple `-remoteWrite.url` flags when writing data to the same cluster.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#replication-and-data-safety).

### Sharding among remote storages

By default `vmagent` replicates data among remote storage systems enumerated via `-remoteWrite.url` command-line flag.
If the `-remoteWrite.shardByURL` command-line flag is set, then `vmagent` spreads evenly
the outgoing [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#time-series)
among all the remote storage systems enumerated via `-remoteWrite.url`. Note that samples for the same
time series are routed to the same remote storage system if `-remoteWrite.shardByURL` flag is specified.
This allows building scalable data processing pipelines when a single remote storage cannot keep up with the data ingestion workload.
For example, this allows building horizontally scalable [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation.html)
by routing outgoing samples for the same time series of [counter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#counter)
and [histogram](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#histogram) types from top-level `vmagent` instances
to the same second-level `vmagent` instance, so they are aggregated properly.

See also [how to scrape big number of targets](#scraping-big-number-of-targets).

### Relabeling and filtering

`vmagent` can add, remove or update labels on the collected data before sending it to the remote storage. Additionally,
it can remove unwanted samples via Prometheus-like relabeling before sending the collected data to remote storage.
Please see [these docs](#relabeling) for details.

### Splitting data streams among multiple systems

`vmagent` supports splitting the collected data between multiple destinations with the help of `-remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig`,
which is applied independently for each configured `-remoteWrite.url` destination. For example, it is possible to replicate or split
data among long-term remote storage, short-term remote storage and a real-time analytical system [built on top of Kafka](https://github.com/Telefonica/prometheus-kafka-adapter).
Note that each destination can receive its own subset of the collected data due to per-destination relabeling via `-remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig`.

### Prometheus remote_write proxy

`vmagent` can be used as a proxy for Prometheus data sent via Prometheus `remote_write` protocol. It can accept data via the `remote_write` API
at the`/api/v1/write` endpoint. Then apply relabeling and filtering and proxy it to another `remote_write` system .
The `vmagent` can be configured to encrypt the incoming `remote_write` requests with `-tls*` command-line flags.
Also, Basic Auth can be enabled for the incoming `remote_write` requests with `-httpAuth.*` command-line flags.

### remote_write for clustered version

While `vmagent` can accept data in several supported protocols (OpenTSDB, Influx, Prometheus, Graphite) and scrape data from various targets,
writes are always performed in Prometheus remote_write protocol. Therefore, for the [clustered version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html),
the `-remoteWrite.url` command-line flag should be configured as `<schema>://<vminsert-host>:8480/insert/<accountID>/prometheus/api/v1/write`
according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#url-format).
There is also support for multitenant writes. See [these docs](#multitenancy).

## VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol

`vmagent` supports sending data to the configured `-remoteWrite.url` either via Prometheus remote write protocol
or via VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol.

VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol provides the following benefits comparing to Prometheus remote write protocol:

- Reduced network bandwidth usage by 2x-5x. This allows saving network bandwidth usage costs when `vmagent` and
  the configured remote storage systems are located in different datacenters, availability zones or regions.

- Reduced disk read/write IO and disk space usage at `vmagent` when the remote storage is temporarily unavailable.
  In this case `vmagent` buffers the incoming data to disk using the VictoriaMetrics remote write format.
  This reduces disk read/write IO and disk space usage by 2x-5x comparing to Prometheus remote write format.

`vmagent` automatically switches to VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol when it sends data to VictoriaMetrics components such as other `vmagent` instances,
[single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html)
or `vminsert` at [cluster version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html).
It is possible to force switch to VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol by specifying `-remoteWrite.forceVMProto`
command-line flag for the corresponding `-remoteWrite.url`.
It is possible to tune the compression level for VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol with `-remoteWrite.vmProtoCompressLevel` command-line flag.
Bigger values reduce network usage at the cost of higher CPU usage. Negative values reduce CPU usage at the cost of higher network usage.

`vmagent` automatically switches to Prometheus remote write protocol when it sends data to old versions of VictoriaMetrics components
or to other Prometheus-compatible remote storage systems. It is possible to force switch to Prometheus remote write protocol
by specifying `-remoteWrite.forcePromProto` command-line flag for the corresponding `-remoteWrite.url`.

## Multitenancy

By default `vmagent` collects the data without tenant identifiers and routes it to the configured `-remoteWrite.url`.

[VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html) supports writing data to multiple tenants
specified via special labels - see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#multitenancy-via-labels).
This allows specifying tenant ids via [relabeling](#relabeling) and writing multitenant data
to a single `-remoteWrite.url=http://<vminsert-addr>/insert/multitenant/prometheus/api/v1/write`.

`vmagent` can accept data from the same multitenant endpoints as `vminsert` from [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html)
does according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#url-format) and route the accepted data
to the corresponding [tenants](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#multitenancy) in VictoriaMetrics cluster
pointed by the `-remoteWrite.multitenantURL` command-line flag. For example, if `-remoteWrite.multitenantURL` is set to `http://vminsert-service`,
then `vmagent` would accept multitenant data at `http://vmagent:8429/insert/<accountID>/...` endpoints in the same way
as [VictoriaMetrics cluster does](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#url-format) and route
it to `http://vminsert-service/insert/<accountID>/prometheus/api/v1/write`.

If multiple `-remoteWrite.multitenantURL` command-line options are set, then `vmagent` replicates the collected data across all the configured urls.
This allows using a single `vmagent` instance in front of multiple VictoriaMetrics clusters.

If `-remoteWrite.multitenantURL` command-line flag is set and `vmagent` is configured to scrape Prometheus-compatible targets
(e.g. if `-promscrape.config` command-line flag is set) then `vmagent` reads tenantID from `__tenant_id__` label
for the discovered targets and routes all the metrics from this target to the given `__tenant_id__`,
e.g. to the url `<-remoteWrite.multitenantURL>/insert/<__tenant_id__>/prometheus/api/v1/write`.

For example, the following relabeling rule instructs sending metrics to tenantID defined in the `prometheus.io/tenant` annotation of Kubernetes pod deployment:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
- kubernetes_sd_configs:
  - role: pod
  relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_tenant]
    target_label: __tenant_id__
```

If the target has no associated `__tenant_id__` label, then its' metrics are routed to zero tenantID, e.g. to `<-remoteWrite.multitenantURL>/insert/0/prometheus/api/v1/write`.

## How to collect metrics in Prometheus format

Specify the path to `prometheus.yml` file via `-promscrape.config` command-line flag. `vmagent` takes into account the following
sections from [Prometheus config file](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/):

* `global`
* `scrape_configs`

All other sections are ignored, including the [remote_write](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write) section.
Use `-remoteWrite.*` command-line flag instead for configuring remote write settings. See [the list of unsupported config sections](#unsupported-prometheus-config-sections).

The file pointed by `-promscrape.config` may contain `%{ENV_VAR}` placeholders which are substituted by the corresponding `ENV_VAR` environment variable values.

See [the list of supported service discovery types for Prometheus scrape targets](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html).


## scrape_config enhancements

`vmagent` supports the following additional options in [scrape_configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#scrape_configs) section:

* `headers` - a list of HTTP headers to send to scrape target with each scrape request. This can be used when the scrape target
  needs custom authorization and authentication. For example:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: custom_headers
  headers:
  - "TenantID: abc"
  - "My-Auth: TopSecret"
```

* `disable_compression: true` for disabling response compression on a per-job basis. By default, `vmagent` requests compressed responses
  from scrape targets for saving network bandwidth.
* `disable_keepalive: true` for disabling [HTTP keep-alive connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection)
  on a per-job basis. By default, `vmagent` uses keep-alive connections to scrape targets for reducing overhead on connection re-establishing.
* `series_limit: N` for limiting the number of unique time series a single scrape target can expose. See [these docs](#cardinality-limiter).
* `stream_parse: true` for scraping targets in a streaming manner. This may be useful when targets export big number of metrics. See [these docs](#stream-parsing-mode).
* `scrape_align_interval: duration` for aligning scrapes to the given interval instead of using random offset
  in the range `[0 ... scrape_interval]` for scraping each target. The random offset helps to spread scrapes evenly in time.
* `scrape_offset: duration` for specifying the exact offset for scraping instead of using random offset in the range `[0 ... scrape_interval]`.

See [scrape_configs docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#scrape_configs) for more details on all the supported options.


## Loading scrape configs from multiple files

`vmagent` supports loading [scrape configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#scrape_configs) from multiple files specified
in the `scrape_config_files` section of `-promscrape.config` file. For example, the following `-promscrape.config` instructs `vmagent`
loading scrape configs from all the `*.yml` files under `configs` directory, from `single_scrape_config.yml` local file
and from `https://config-server/scrape_config.yml` url:

```yml
scrape_config_files:
- configs/*.yml
- single_scrape_config.yml
- https://config-server/scrape_config.yml
```

Every referred file can contain arbitrary number of [supported scrape configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#scrape_configs).
There is no need in specifying top-level `scrape_configs` section in these files. For example:

```yml
- job_name: foo
  static_configs:
  - targets: ["vmagent:8429"]
- job_name: bar
  kubernetes_sd_configs:
  - role: pod
```

`vmagent` is able to dynamically reload these files - see [these docs](#configuration-update).

## Unsupported Prometheus config sections

`vmagent` doesn't support the following sections in Prometheus config file passed to `-promscrape.config` command-line flag:

* [remote_write](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write). This section is substituted
  with various `-remoteWrite*` command-line flags. See [the full list of flags](#advanced-usage). The `remote_write` section isn't supported
  in order to reduce possible confusion when `vmagent` is used for accepting incoming metrics via [supported push protocols](#how-to-push-data-to-vmagent).
  In this case the `-promscrape.config` file isn't needed.
* `remote_read`. This section isn't supported at all, since `vmagent` doesn't provide Prometheus querying API.
  It is expected that the querying API is provided by the remote storage specified via `-remoteWrite.url` such as VictoriaMetrics.
  See [Prometheus querying API docs for VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#prometheus-querying-api-usage).
* `rule_files` and `alerting`. These sections are supported by [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html).

The list of supported service discovery types is available [here](#how-to-collect-metrics-in-prometheus-format).

Additionally, `vmagent` doesn't support `refresh_interval` option at service discovery sections.
This option is substituted with `-promscrape.*CheckInterval` command-line options, which are specific per each service discovery type.
See [the full list of command-line flags for vmagent](#advanced-usage).

## Adding labels to metrics

Extra labels can be added to metrics collected by `vmagent` via the following mechanisms:

* The `global -> external_labels` section in `-promscrape.config` file. These labels are added only to metrics scraped from targets configured
  in the `-promscrape.config` file. They aren't added to metrics collected via other [data ingestion protocols](#how-to-push-data-to-vmagent).
* The `-remoteWrite.label` command-line flag. These labels are added to all the collected metrics before sending them to `-remoteWrite.url`.
  For example, the following command starts `vmagent`, which adds `{datacenter="foobar"}` label to all the metrics pushed
  to all the configured remote storage systems (all the `-remoteWrite.url` flag values):

  ```
  /path/to/vmagent -remoteWrite.label=datacenter=foobar ...
  ```

* Via relabeling. See [these docs](#relabeling).


## Automatically generated metrics

`vmagent` automatically generates the following metrics per each scrape of every [Prometheus-compatible target](#how-to-collect-metrics-in-prometheus-format)
and attaches `instance`, `job` and other target-specific labels to these metrics:

* `up` - this metric exposes `1` value on successful scrape and `0` value on unsuccessful scrape. This allows monitoring
  failing scrapes with the following [MetricsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html):

  ```metricsql
  up == 0
  ```

* `scrape_duration_seconds` - the duration of the scrape for the given target. This allows monitoring slow scrapes.
  For example, the following [MetricsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html) returns scrapes,
  which take more than 1.5 seconds to complete:

  ```metricsql
  scrape_duration_seconds > 1.5
  ```

* `scrape_timeout_seconds` - the configured timeout for the current scrape target (aka `scrape_timeout`).
  This allows detecting targets with scrape durations close to the configured scrape timeout.
  For example, the following [MetricsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html) returns targets (identified by `instance` label),
  which take more than 80% of the configured `scrape_timeout` during scrapes:

  ```metricsql
  scrape_duration_seconds / scrape_timeout_seconds > 0.8
  ```

* `scrape_samples_scraped` - the number of samples (aka metrics) parsed per each scrape. This allows detecting targets,
  which expose too many metrics. For example, the following [MetricsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html)
  returns targets, which expose more than 10000 metrics:

  ```metricsql
  scrape_samples_scraped > 10000
  ```

* `scrape_samples_limit` - the configured limit on the number of metrics the given target can expose.
  The limit can be set via `sample_limit` option at [scrape_configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#scrape_configs).
  This metric is exposed only if the `sample_limit` is set. This allows detecting targets,
  which expose too many metrics compared to the configured `sample_limit`. For example, the following query
  returns targets (identified by `instance` label), which expose more than 80% metrics compared to the configed `sample_limit`:

  ```metricsql
  scrape_samples_scraped / scrape_samples_limit > 0.8
  ```

* `scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling` - the number of samples (aka metrics) left after applying metric-level relabeling
  from `metric_relabel_configs` section (see [relabeling docs](#relabeling) for more details).
  This allows detecting targets with too many metrics after the relabeling.
  For example, the following [MetricsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html) returns targets
  with more than 10000 metrics after the relabeling:

  ```metricsql
  scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling > 10000
  ```

* `scrape_series_added` - **an approximate** number of new series the given target generates during the current scrape.
  This metric allows detecting targets (identified by `instance` label),
  which lead to [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-high-churn-rate).
  For example, the following [MetricsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html) returns targets,
  which generate more than 1000 new series during the last hour:

  ```metricsql
  sum_over_time(scrape_series_added[1h]) > 1000
  ```

  `vmagent` sets `scrape_series_added` to zero when it runs with `-promscrape.noStaleMarkers` command-line option
  or when it scrapes target with `no_stale_markers: true` option, e.g. when [staleness markers](#prometheus-staleness-markers) are disabled.

* `scrape_series_limit` - the limit on the number of unique time series the given target can expose according to [these docs](#cardinality-limiter).
  This metric is exposed only if the series limit is set.

* `scrape_series_current` - the number of unique series the given target exposed so far.
  This metric is exposed only if the series limit is set according to [these docs](#cardinality-limiter).
  This metric allows alerting when the number of exposed series by the given target reaches the limit.
  For example, the following query would alert when the target exposes more than 90% of unique series compared to the configured limit.

  ```metricsql
  scrape_series_current / scrape_series_limit > 0.9
  ```

* `scrape_series_limit_samples_dropped` - exposes the number of dropped samples during the scrape because of the exceeded limit
  on the number of unique series. This metric is exposed only if the series limit is set according to [these docs](#cardinality-limiter).
  This metric allows alerting when scraped samples are dropped because of the exceeded limit.
  For example, the following query alerts when at least a single sample is dropped because of the exceeded limit during the last hour:

  ```metricsql
  sum_over_time(scrape_series_limit_samples_dropped[1h]) > 0
  ```

If the target exports metrics with names clashing with the automatically generated metric names, then `vmagent` automatically
adds `exported_` prefix to these metric names, so they don't clash with automatically generated metric names.


## Relabeling

VictoriaMetrics components support [Prometheus-compatible relabeling](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config)
with [additional enhancements](#relabeling-enhancements). The relabeling can be defined in the following places processed by `vmagent`:

* At the `scrape_config -> relabel_configs` section in `-promscrape.config` file.
  This relabeling is used for modifying labels in discovered targets and for dropping unneeded targets.
  See [relabeling cookbook](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/relabeling.html) for details.

  This relabeling can be debugged by clicking the `debug` link at the corresponding target on the `http://vmagent:8429/targets` page
  or on the `http://vmagent:8429/service-discovery` page. See [these docs](#relabel-debug) for details.
  The link is unavailable if `vmagent` runs with `-promscrape.dropOriginalLabels` command-line flag.

* At the `scrape_config -> metric_relabel_configs` section in `-promscrape.config` file.
  This relabeling is used for modifying labels in scraped metrics and for dropping unneeded metrics.
  See [relabeling cookbook](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/relabeling.html) for details.

  This relabeling can be debugged via `http://vmagent:8429/metric-relabel-debug` page. See [these docs](#relabel-debug) for details.

* At the `-remoteWrite.relabelConfig` file. This relabeling is used for modifying labels for all the collected metrics
  (including [metrics obtained via push-based protocols](#how-to-push-data-to-vmagent)) and for dropping unneeded metrics
  before sending them to all the configured `-remoteWrite.url` addresses.

  This relabeling can be debugged via `http://vmagent:8429/metric-relabel-debug` page. See [these docs](#relabel-debug) for details.

* At the `-remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig` files. This relabeling is used for modifying labels for metrics
  and for dropping unneeded metrics before sending them to a particular `-remoteWrite.url`.

  This relabeling can be debugged via `http://vmagent:8429/metric-relabel-debug` page. See [these docs](#relabel-debug) for details.

All the files with relabeling configs can contain special placeholders in the form `%{ENV_VAR}`,
which are replaced by the corresponding environment variable values.

The following articles contain useful information about Prometheus relabeling:

* [relabel_configs vs metric_relabel_configs](https://www.robustperception.io/relabel_configs-vs-metric_relabel_configs)

## Relabeling enhancements

`vmagent` provides the following enhancements on top of Prometheus-compatible relabeling:

* The `replacement` option can refer arbitrary labels via {% raw %}`{{label_name}}`{% endraw %} placeholders.
  Such placeholders are substituted with the corresponding label value. For example, the following relabeling rule
  sets `instance-job` label value to `host123-foo` when applied to the metric with `{instance="host123",job="foo"}` labels:

  {% raw %}
  ```yaml
  - target_label: "instance-job"
    replacement: "{{instance}}-{{job}}"
  ```
  {% endraw %}

* An optional `if` filter can be used for conditional relabeling. The `if` filter may contain
  arbitrary [time series selector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#filtering).
  The `action` is performed only for [samples](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#raw-samples), which match the provided `if` filter.
  For example, the following relabeling rule keeps metrics matching `foo{bar="baz"}` series selector, while dropping the rest of metrics:

  ```yaml
  - if: 'foo{bar="baz"}'
    action: keep
  ```

  This is equivalent to less clear Prometheus-compatible relabeling rule:

  ```yaml
  - action: keep
    source_labels: [__name__, bar]
    regex: 'foo;baz'
  ```

  The `if` option may contain more than one filter. In this case the `action` is performed if at least a single filter
  matches the given [sample](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#raw-samples).
  For example, the following relabeling rule adds `foo="bar"` label to samples with `job="foo"` or `instance="bar"` labels:

  ```yaml
  - target_label: foo
    replacement: bar
    if:
    - '{job="foo"}'
    - '{instance="bar"}'
  ```

* The `regex` value can be split into multiple lines for improved readability and maintainability.
  These lines are automatically joined with `|` char when parsed. For example, the following configs are equivalent:

  ```yaml
  - action: keep_metrics
    regex: "metric_a|metric_b|foo_.+"
  ```

  ```yaml
  - action: keep_metrics
    regex:
    - "metric_a"
    - "metric_b"
    - "foo_.+"
  ```

* VictoriaMetrics provides the following additional relabeling actions on top of standard actions
  from the [Prometheus relabeling](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config):

  * `replace_all` replaces all the occurrences of `regex` in the values of `source_labels` with the `replacement`
    and stores the results in the `target_label`. For example, the following relabeling config replaces all the occurrences
    of `-` char in metric names with `_` char (e.g. `foo-bar-baz` metric name is transformed into `foo_bar_baz`):

    ```yaml
    - action: replace_all
      source_labels: ["__name__"]
      target_label: "__name__"
      regex: "-"
      replacement: "_"
    ```

  * `labelmap_all` replaces all the occurrences of `regex` in all the label names with the `replacement`.
    For example, the following relabeling config replaces all the occurrences of `-` char in all the label names
    with `_` char (e.g. `foo-bar-baz` label name is transformed into `foo_bar_baz`):

    ```yaml
    - action: labelmap_all
      regex: "-"
      replacement: "_"
    ```

  * `keep_if_equal`: keeps the entry if all the label values from `source_labels` are equal,
    while dropping all the other entries. For example, the following relabeling config keeps targets
    if they contain equal values for `instance` and `host` labels, while dropping all the other targets:

    ```yaml
    - action: keep_if_equal
      source_labels: ["instance", "host"]
    ```

  * `drop_if_equal`: drops the entry if all the label values from `source_labels` are equal,
    while keeping all the other entries. For example, the following relabeling config drops targets
    if they contain equal values for `instance` and `host` labels, while keeping all the other targets:

    ```yaml
    - action: drop_if_equal
      source_labels: ["instance", "host"]
    ```

  * `keep_metrics`: keeps all the metrics with names matching the given `regex`,
    while dropping all the other metrics. For example, the following relabeling config keeps metrics
    with `foo` and `bar` names, while dropping all the other metrics:

    ```yaml
    - action: keep_metrics
      regex: "foo|bar"
    ```

  * `drop_metrics`: drops all the metrics with names matching the given `regex`, while keeping all the other metrics.
    For example, the following relabeling config drops metrics with `foo` and `bar` names, while leaving all the other metrics:

    ```yaml
    - action: drop_metrics
      regex: "foo|bar"
    ```

  * `graphite`: applies Graphite-style relabeling to metric name. See [these docs](#graphite-relabeling) for details.

## Graphite relabeling

VictoriaMetrics components support `action: graphite` relabeling rules, which allow extracting various parts from Graphite-style metrics
into the configured labels with the syntax similar to [Glob matching in statsd_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter#glob-matching).
Note that the `name` field must be substituted with explicit `__name__` option under `labels` section.
If `__name__` option is missing under `labels` section, then the original Graphite-style metric name is left unchanged.

For example, the following relabeling rule generates `requests_total{job="app42",instance="host124:8080"}` metric
from `app42.host123.requests.total` Graphite-style metric:

```yaml
- action: graphite
  match: "*.*.*.total"
  labels:
    __name__: "${3}_total"
    job: "$1"
    instance: "${2}:8080"
```

Important notes about `action: graphite` relabeling rules:

- The relabeling rule is applied only to metrics, which match the given `match` expression. Other metrics remain unchanged.
- The `*` matches the maximum possible number of chars until the next dot or until the next part of the `match` expression whichever comes first.
  It may match zero chars if the next char is `.`.
  For example, `match: "app*foo.bar"` matches `app42foo.bar` and `42` becomes available to use at `labels` section via `$1` capture group.
- The `$0` capture group matches the original metric name.
- The relabeling rules are executed in order defined in the original config.

The `action: graphite` relabeling rules are easier to write and maintain than `action: replace` for labels extraction from Graphite-style metric names.
Additionally, the `action: graphite` relabeling rules usually work much faster than the equivalent `action: replace` rules.

## Relabel debug

`vmagent` and [single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html)
provide the following tools for debugging target-level and metric-level relabeling:

- Target-level debugging (e.g. `relabel_configs` section at [scrape_configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#scrape_configs))
  can be performed by navigating to `http://vmagent:8429/targets` page (`http://victoriametrics:8428/targets` page for single-node VictoriaMetrics)
  and clicking the `debug target relabeling` link at the target, which must be debugged.
  The link is unavailable if `vmagent` runs with `-promscrape.dropOriginalLabels` command-line flag.
  The opened page shows step-by-step results for the actual target relabeling rules applied to the discovered target labels.
  The page shows also the target URL generated after applying all the relabeling rules.

  The `http://vmagent:8429/targets` page shows only active targets. If you need to understand why some target
  is dropped during the relabeling, then navigate to `http://vmagent:8428/service-discovery` page
  (`http://victoriametrics:8428/service-discovery` for single-node VictoriaMetrics), find the dropped target
  and click the `debug` link there. The link is unavailable if `vmagent` runs with `-promscrape.dropOriginalLabels` command-line flag.
  The opened page shows step-by-step results for the actual relabeling rules, which result to target drop.

- Metric-level debugging (e.g. `metric_relabel_configs` section at [scrape_configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#scrape_configs)
  can be performed by navigating to `http://vmagent:8429/targets` page (`http://victoriametrics:8428/targets` page for single-node VictoriaMetrics)
  and clicking the `debug metrics relabeling` link at the target, which must be debugged.
  The link is unavailable if `vmagent` runs with `-promscrape.dropOriginalLabels` command-line flag.
  The opened page shows step-by-step results for the actual metric relabeling rules applied to the given target labels.

## Prometheus staleness markers

`vmagent` sends [Prometheus staleness markers](https://www.robustperception.io/staleness-and-promql) to `-remoteWrite.url` in the following cases:

* If they are passed to `vmagent` via [Prometheus remote_write protocol](#prometheus-remote_write-proxy).
* If the metric disappears from the list of scraped metrics, then stale marker is sent to this particular metric.
* If the scrape target becomes temporarily unavailable, then stale markers are sent for all the metrics scraped from this target.
* If the scrape target is removed from the list of targets, then stale markers are sent for all the metrics scraped from this target.

Prometheus staleness markers' tracking needs additional memory, since it must store the previous response body per each scrape target
in order to compare it to the current response body. The memory usage may be reduced by disabling staleness tracking in the following ways:

* By passing `-promscrape.noStaleMarkers` command-line flag to `vmagent`. This disables staleness tracking across all the targets.
* By specifying `no_stale_markers: true` option in the [scrape_config](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#scrape_configs) for the corresponding target.

When staleness tracking is disabled, then `vmagent` doesn't track the number of new time series per each scrape,
e.g. it sets `scrape_series_added` metric to zero. See [these docs](#automatically-generated-metrics) for details.

## Stream parsing mode

By default, `vmagent` reads the full response body from scrape target into memory, then parses it, applies [relabeling](#relabeling)
and then pushes the resulting metrics to the configured `-remoteWrite.url`. This mode works good for the majority of cases
when the scrape target exposes small number of metrics (e.g. less than 10 thousand). But this mode may take big amounts of memory
when the scrape target exposes big number of metrics. In this case it is recommended enabling stream parsing mode.
When this mode is enabled, then `vmagent` reads response from scrape target in chunks, then immediately processes every chunk
and pushes the processed metrics to remote storage. This allows saving memory when scraping targets that expose millions of metrics.

Stream parsing mode is automatically enabled for scrape targets returning response bodies with sizes bigger than
the `-promscrape.minResponseSizeForStreamParse` command-line flag value. Additionally,
stream parsing mode can be explicitly enabled in the following places:

* Via `-promscrape.streamParse` command-line flag. In this case all the scrape targets defined
  in the file pointed by `-promscrape.config` are scraped in stream parsing mode.
* Via `stream_parse: true` option at `scrape_configs` section. In this case all the scrape targets defined
  in this section are scraped in stream parsing mode.
* Via `__stream_parse__=true` label, which can be set via [relabeling](#relabeling) at `relabel_configs` section.
  In this case stream parsing mode is enabled for the corresponding scrape targets.
  Typical use case: to set the label via [Kubernetes annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/)
  for targets exposing big number of metrics.

Examples:

```yml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'big-federate'
  stream_parse: true
  static_configs:
  - targets:
    - big-prometheus1
    - big-prometheus2
  honor_labels: true
  metrics_path: /federate
  params:
    'match[]': ['{__name__!=""}']
```

Note that `vmagent` in stream parsing mode stores up to `sample_limit` samples to the configured `-remoteStorage.url`
instead of dropping all the samples read from the target, because the parsed data is sent to the remote storage
as soon as it is parsed in stream parsing mode.

## Scraping big number of targets

A single `vmagent` instance can scrape tens of thousands of scrape targets. Sometimes this isn't enough due to limitations on CPU, network, RAM, etc.
In this case scrape targets can be split among multiple `vmagent` instances (aka `vmagent` horizontal scaling, sharding and clustering).
Each `vmagent` instance in the cluster must use identical `-promscrape.config` files with distinct `-promscrape.cluster.memberNum` values.
The flag value must be in the range `0 ... N-1`, where `N` is the number of `vmagent` instances in the cluster.
The number of `vmagent` instances in the cluster must be passed to `-promscrape.cluster.membersCount` command-line flag. For example, the following commands
spread scrape targets among a cluster of two `vmagent` instances:

```
/path/to/vmagent -promscrape.cluster.membersCount=2 -promscrape.cluster.memberNum=0 -promscrape.config=/path/to/config.yml ...
/path/to/vmagent -promscrape.cluster.membersCount=2 -promscrape.cluster.memberNum=1 -promscrape.config=/path/to/config.yml ...
```

The `-promscrape.cluster.memberNum` can be set to a StatefulSet pod name when `vmagent` runs in Kubernetes.
The pod name must end with a number in the range `0 ... promscrape.cluster.memberNum-1`. For example, `-promscrape.cluster.memberNum=vmagent-0`.

By default, each scrape target is scraped only by a single `vmagent` instance in the cluster. If there is a need for replicating scrape targets among multiple `vmagent` instances,
then `-promscrape.cluster.replicationFactor` command-line flag must be set to the desired number of replicas. For example, the following commands
start a cluster of three `vmagent` instances, where each target is scraped by two `vmagent` instances:

```
/path/to/vmagent -promscrape.cluster.membersCount=3 -promscrape.cluster.replicationFactor=2 -promscrape.cluster.memberNum=0 -promscrape.config=/path/to/config.yml ...
/path/to/vmagent -promscrape.cluster.membersCount=3 -promscrape.cluster.replicationFactor=2 -promscrape.cluster.memberNum=1 -promscrape.config=/path/to/config.yml ...
/path/to/vmagent -promscrape.cluster.membersCount=3 -promscrape.cluster.replicationFactor=2 -promscrape.cluster.memberNum=2 -promscrape.config=/path/to/config.yml ...
```

If each target is scraped by multiple `vmagent` instances, then data deduplication must be enabled at remote storage pointed by `-remoteWrite.url`.
The `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` must be set to the `scrape_interval` configured at `-promscrape.config`.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#deduplication) for details.

See also [how to shard data among multiple remote storage systems](#sharding-among-remote-storages).


## High availability

It is possible to run multiple **identically configured** `vmagent` instances or `vmagent` 
[clusters](#scraping-big-number-of-targets), so they [scrape](#how-to-collect-metrics-in-prometheus-format) 
the same set of targets and push the collected data to the same set of VictoriaMetrics remote storage systems. 
Two **identically configured** vmagent instances or clusters is usually called an HA pair.

When running HA pairs, [deduplication](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#deduplication) must be configured 
at VictoriaMetrics side in order to de-duplicate received samples.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#deduplication) for details.

It is also recommended passing different values to `-promscrape.cluster.name` command-line flag per each `vmagent` 
instance or per each `vmagent` cluster in HA setup. This is needed for proper data de-duplication. 
See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2679) for details.

## Scraping targets via a proxy

`vmagent` supports scraping targets via http, https and socks5 proxies. Proxy address must be specified in `proxy_url` option. For example, the following scrape config instructs
target scraping via https proxy at `https://proxy-addr:1234`:

```yml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: foo
  proxy_url: https://proxy-addr:1234
```

Proxy can be configured with the following optional settings:

* `proxy_authorization` for generic token authorization. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#http-api-client-options).
* `proxy_basic_auth` for Basic authorization. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#http-api-client-options).
* `proxy_bearer_token` and `proxy_bearer_token_file` for Bearer token authorization
* `proxy_oauth2` for OAuth2 config. See [these docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#oauth2).
* `proxy_tls_config` for TLS config. See [these docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#tls_config).
* `proxy_headers` for passing additional HTTP headers in requests to proxy.

For example:

```yml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: foo
  proxy_url: https://proxy-addr:1234
  proxy_basic_auth:
    username: foobar
    password: secret
  proxy_tls_config:
    insecure_skip_verify: true
    cert_file: /path/to/cert
    key_file: /path/to/key
    ca_file: /path/to/ca
    server_name: real-server-name
  proxy_headers:
  - "Proxy-Auth: top-secret"
```

## Cardinality limiter

By default, `vmagent` doesn't limit the number of time series each scrape target can expose.
The limit can be enforced in the following places:

* Via `-promscrape.seriesLimitPerTarget` command-line option. This limit is applied individually
  to all the scrape targets defined in the file pointed by `-promscrape.config`.
* Via `series_limit` config option at [scrape_config](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#scrape_configs) section.
  This limit is applied individually to all the scrape targets defined in the given `scrape_config`.
* Via `__series_limit__` label, which can be set with [relabeling](#relabeling) at `relabel_configs` section.
  This limit is applied to the corresponding scrape targets. Typical use case: to set the limit
  via [Kubernetes annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) for targets,
  which may expose too high number of time series.

Scraped metrics are dropped for time series exceeding the given limit on the time window of 24h.
`vmagent` creates the following additional per-target metrics for targets with non-zero series limit:

- `scrape_series_limit_samples_dropped` - the number of dropped samples during the scrape when the unique series limit is exceeded.
- `scrape_series_limit` - the series limit for the given target.
- `scrape_series_current` - the current number of series for the given target.

These metrics are automatically sent to the configured `-remoteWrite.url` alongside with the scraped per-target metrics.

These metrics allow building the following alerting rules:

- `scrape_series_current / scrape_series_limit > 0.9` - alerts when the number of series exposed by the target reaches 90% of the limit.
- `sum_over_time(scrape_series_limit_samples_dropped[1h]) > 0` - alerts when some samples are dropped because the series limit on a particular target is reached.

See also `sample_limit` option at [scrape_config section](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#scrape_configs).

By default, `vmagent` doesn't limit the number of time series written to remote storage systems specified at `-remoteWrite.url`.
The limit can be enforced by setting the following command-line flags:

* `-remoteWrite.maxHourlySeries` - limits the number of unique time series `vmagent` can write to remote storage systems during the last hour.
  Useful for limiting the number of active time series.
* `-remoteWrite.maxDailySeries` - limits the number of unique time series `vmagent` can write to remote storage systems during the last day.
  Useful for limiting daily churn rate.

Both limits can be set simultaneously. If any of these limits is reached, then samples for new time series are dropped instead of sending
them to remote storage systems. A sample of dropped series is put in the log with `WARNING` level.

`vmagent` exposes the following metrics at `http://vmagent:8429/metrics` page (see [monitoring docs](#monitoring) for details):

* `vmagent_hourly_series_limit_rows_dropped_total` - the number of metrics dropped due to exceeded hourly limit on the number of unique time series.
* `vmagent_hourly_series_limit_max_series` - the hourly series limit set via `-remoteWrite.maxHourlySeries`.
* `vmagent_hourly_series_limit_current_series` - the current number of unique series registered during the last hour.
* `vmagent_daily_series_limit_rows_dropped_total` - the number of metrics dropped due to exceeded daily limit on the number of unique time series.
* `vmagent_daily_series_limit_max_series` - the daily series limit set via `-remoteWrite.maxDailySeries`.
* `vmagent_daily_series_limit_current_series` - the current number of unique series registered during the last day.

These limits are approximate, so `vmagent` can underflow/overflow the limit by a small percentage (usually less than 1%).

See also [cardinality explorer docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#cardinality-explorer).

## Monitoring

`vmagent` exports various metrics in Prometheus exposition format at `http://vmagent-host:8429/metrics` page.
We recommend setting up regular scraping of this page either through `vmagent` itself or by Prometheus
so that the exported metrics may be analyzed later.

Use official [Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12683-victoriametrics-vmagent/) for `vmagent` state overview.
Graphs on this dashboard contain useful hints - hover the `i` icon at the top left corner of each graph in order to read it.
If you have suggestions for improvements or have found a bug - please open an issue on github or add a review to the dashboard.

`vmagent` also exports the status for various targets at the following pages:

* `http://vmagent-host:8429/targets`. This pages shows the current status for every active target.
* `http://vmagent-host:8429/service-discovery`. This pages shows the list of discovered targets with the discovered `__meta_*` labels
  according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html).
  This page may help debugging target [relabeling](#relabeling).
* `http://vmagent-host:8429/api/v1/targets`. This handler returns JSON response
  compatible with [the corresponding page from Prometheus API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#targets).
* `http://vmagent-host:8429/ready`. This handler returns http 200 status code when `vmagent` finishes
  its initialization for all the [service_discovery configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html).
  It may be useful to perform `vmagent` rolling update without any scrape loss.

## Troubleshooting

* We recommend you [set up the official Grafana dashboard](#monitoring) in order to monitor the state of `vmagent'.

* We recommend you increase the maximum number of open files in the system (`ulimit -n`) when scraping a big number of targets,
  as `vmagent` establishes at least a single TCP connection per target.

* If `vmagent` uses too big amounts of memory, then the following options can help:
  * Disabling staleness tracking with `-promscrape.noStaleMarkers` option. See [these docs](#prometheus-staleness-markers).
  * Enabling stream parsing mode if `vmagent` scrapes targets with millions of metrics per target. See [these docs](#stream-parsing-mode).
  * Reducing the number of output queues with `-remoteWrite.queues` command-line option.
  * Reducing the amounts of RAM vmagent can use for in-memory buffering with `-memory.allowedPercent` or `-memory.allowedBytes` command-line option.
    Another option is to reduce memory limits in Docker and/or Kubernetes if `vmagent` runs under these systems.
  * Reducing the number of CPU cores vmagent can use by passing `GOMAXPROCS=N` environment variable to `vmagent`,
    where `N` is the desired limit on CPU cores. Another option is to reduce CPU limits in Docker or Kubernetes if `vmagent` runs under these systems.
  * Passing `-promscrape.dropOriginalLabels` command-line option to `vmagent`, so it drops `"discoveredLabels"` and `"droppedTargets"`
    lists at `/api/v1/targets` page. This reduces memory usage when scraping big number of targets at the cost
    of reduced debuggability for improperly configured per-target relabeling.

* When `vmagent` scrapes many unreliable targets, it can flood the error log with scrape errors. These errors can be suppressed
  by passing `-promscrape.suppressScrapeErrors` command-line flag to `vmagent`. The most recent scrape error per each target can be observed at `http://vmagent-host:8429/targets`
  and `http://vmagent-host:8429/api/v1/targets`.

* The `/service-discovery` page could be useful for debugging relabeling process for scrape targets.
  This page contains original labels for targets dropped during relabeling.
  By default, the `-promscrape.maxDroppedTargets` targets are shown here. If your setup drops more targets during relabeling,
  then increase `-promscrape.maxDroppedTargets` command-line flag value to see all the dropped targets.
  Note that tracking each dropped target requires up to 10Kb of RAM. Therefore, big values for `-promscrape.maxDroppedTargets`
  may result in increased memory usage if a big number of scrape targets are dropped during relabeling.

* We recommend you increase `-remoteWrite.queues` if `vmagent_remotewrite_pending_data_bytes` metric exported
  at `http://vmagent-host:8429/metrics` page grows constantly. It is also recommended increasing `-remoteWrite.maxBlockSize`
  and `-remoteWrite.maxRowsPerBlock` command-line options in this case. This can improve data ingestion performance
  to the configured remote storage systems at the cost of higher memory usage.

* If you see gaps in the data pushed by `vmagent` to remote storage when `-remoteWrite.maxDiskUsagePerURL` is set,
  try increasing `-remoteWrite.queues`. Such gaps may appear because `vmagent` cannot keep up with sending the collected data to remote storage.
  Therefore, it starts dropping the buffered data if the on-disk buffer size exceeds `-remoteWrite.maxDiskUsagePerURL`.

* `vmagent` drops data blocks if remote storage replies with `400 Bad Request` and `409 Conflict` HTTP responses.
  The number of dropped blocks can be monitored via `vmagent_remotewrite_packets_dropped_total` metric exported at [/metrics page](#monitoring).

* Use `-remoteWrite.queues=1` when `-remoteWrite.url` points to remote storage, which doesn't accept out-of-order samples (aka data backfilling).
  Such storage systems include Prometheus, Mimir, Cortex and Thanos, which typically emit `out of order sample` errors.
  The best solution is to use remote storage with [backfilling support](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#backfilling) such as VictoriaMetrics.

* `vmagent` buffers scraped data at the `-remoteWrite.tmpDataPath` directory until it is sent to `-remoteWrite.url`.
  The directory can grow large when remote storage is unavailable for extended periods of time and if `-remoteWrite.maxDiskUsagePerURL` isn't set.
  If you don't want to send all the data from the directory to remote storage then simply stop `vmagent` and delete the directory.

* By default `vmagent` masks `-remoteWrite.url` with `secret-url` values in logs and at `/metrics` page because
  the url may contain sensitive information such as auth tokens or passwords.
  Pass `-remoteWrite.showURL` command-line flag when starting `vmagent` in order to see all the valid urls.

* By default `vmagent` evenly spreads scrape load in time. If a particular scrape target must be scraped at the beginning of some interval,
  then `scrape_align_interval` option  must be used. For example, the following config aligns hourly scrapes to the beginning of hour:

  ```yml
  scrape_configs:
  - job_name: foo
    scrape_interval: 1h
    scrape_align_interval: 1h
  ```

* By default `vmagent` evenly spreads scrape load in time. If a particular scrape target must be scraped at specific offset, then `scrape_offset` option must be used.
  For example, the following config instructs `vmagent` to scrape the target at 10 seconds of every minute:

  ```yml
  scrape_configs:
  - job_name: foo
    scrape_interval: 1m
    scrape_offset: 10s
  ```

* If you see `skipping duplicate scrape target with identical labels` errors when scraping Kubernetes pods, then it is likely these pods listen to multiple ports
  or they use an init container. These errors can either be fixed or suppressed with the `-promscrape.suppressDuplicateScrapeTargetErrors` command-line flag.
  See the available options below if you prefer fixing the root cause of the error:

  The following relabeling rule may be added to `relabel_configs` section in order to filter out pods with unneeded ports:

  ```yml
  - action: keep_if_equal
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_port, __meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_number]
  ```

  The following relabeling rule may be added to `relabel_configs` section in order to filter out init container pods:

  ```yml
  - action: drop
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_init]
    regex: true
  ```

See also [troubleshooting docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Troubleshooting.html).

## Kafka integration

[Enterprise version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html) of `vmagent` can read and write metrics from / to Kafka:

* [Reading metrics from Kafka](#reading-metrics-from-kafka)
* [Writing metrics to Kafka](#writing-metrics-to-kafka)

The enterprise version of vmagent is available for evaluation at [releases](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases) page
in `vmutils-...-enterprise.tar.gz` archives and in [docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/vmagent/tags) with tags containing `enterprise` suffix.

### Reading metrics from Kafka

[Enterprise version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html) of `vmagent` can read metrics in various formats from Kafka messages.
These formats can be configured with `-kafka.consumer.topic.defaultFormat` or `-kafka.consumer.topic.format` command-line options. The following formats are supported:

* `promremotewrite` - [Prometheus remote_write](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write).
  Messages in this format can be sent by vmagent - see [these docs](#writing-metrics-to-kafka).
* `influx` - [InfluxDB line protocol format](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_tutorial/).
* `prometheus` - [Prometheus text exposition format](https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/master/content/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats.md#text-based-format)
  and [OpenMetrics format](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/master/specification/OpenMetrics.md).
* `graphite` - [Graphite plaintext format](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-plaintext-protocol).
* `jsonline` - [JSON line format](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-import-data-in-json-line-format).

Every Kafka message may contain multiple lines in `influx`, `prometheus`, `graphite` and `jsonline` format delimited by `\n`.

`vmagent` consumes messages from Kafka topics specified by `-kafka.consumer.topic` command-line flag. Multiple topics can be specified
by passing multiple `-kafka.consumer.topic` command-line flags to `vmagent`.

`vmagent` consumes messages from Kafka brokers specified by `-kafka.consumer.topic.brokers` command-line flag.
Multiple brokers can be specified per each `-kafka.consumer.topic` by passing a list of brokers delimited by `;`.
For example, `-kafka.consumer.topic.brokers=host1:9092;host2:9092`.

The following command starts `vmagent`, which reads metrics in InfluxDB line protocol format from Kafka broker at `localhost:9092`
from the topic `metrics-by-telegraf` and sends them to remote storage at `http://localhost:8428/api/v1/write`:

```console
./bin/vmagent -remoteWrite.url=http://localhost:8428/api/v1/write \
       -kafka.consumer.topic.brokers=localhost:9092 \
       -kafka.consumer.topic.format=influx \
       -kafka.consumer.topic=metrics-by-telegraf \
       -kafka.consumer.topic.groupID=some-id
```

It is expected that [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) sends metrics to the `metrics-by-telegraf` topic with the following config:

```yaml
[[outputs.kafka]]
brokers = ["localhost:9092"]
topic = "influx"
data_format = "influx"
```

#### Command-line flags for Kafka consumer

These command-line flags are available only in [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html) version of `vmagent`,
which can be downloaded for evaluation from [releases](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases) page
(see `vmutils-...-enterprise.tar.gz` archives) and from [docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/vmagent/tags) with tags containing `enterprise` suffix.

```

### Writing metrics to Kafka

[Enterprise version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html) of `vmagent` writes data to Kafka with `at-least-once`
semantics if `-remoteWrite.url` contains e.g. Kafka url. For example, if `vmagent` is started with `-remoteWrite.url=kafka://localhost:9092/?topic=prom-rw`,
then it would send Prometheus remote_write messages to Kafka bootstrap server at `localhost:9092` with the topic `prom-rw`.
These messages can be read later from Kafka by another `vmagent` - see [these docs](#reading-metrics-from-kafka) for details.

Additional Kafka options can be passed as query params to `-remoteWrite.url`. For instance, `kafka://localhost:9092/?topic=prom-rw&client.id=my-favorite-id`
sets `client.id` Kafka option to `my-favorite-id`. The full list of Kafka options is available [here](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md).

#### Kafka broker authorization and authentication

Two types of auth are supported:

* sasl with username and password:

```console
./bin/vmagent -remoteWrite.url=kafka://localhost:9092/?topic=prom-rw&security.protocol=SASL_SSL&sasl.mechanisms=PLAIN -remoteWrite.basicAuth.username=user -remoteWrite.basicAuth.password=password
```

* tls certificates:

```console
./bin/vmagent -remoteWrite.url=kafka://localhost:9092/?topic=prom-rw&security.protocol=SSL -remoteWrite.tlsCAFile=/opt/ca.pem -remoteWrite.tlsCertFile=/opt/cert.pem -remoteWrite.tlsKeyFile=/opt/key.pem
```

## How to build from sources

We recommend using [official binary releases](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases) - `vmagent` is located in the `vmutils-...` archives.

It may be needed to build `vmagent` from source code when developing or testing new feature or bugfix.

### Development build

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install). The minimum supported version is Go 1.19.
1. Run `make vmagent` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds the `vmagent` binary and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Production build

1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
1. Run `make vmagent-prod` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds `vmagent-prod` binary and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Building docker images

Run `make package-vmagent`. It builds `victoriametrics/vmagent:<PKG_TAG>` docker image locally.
`<PKG_TAG>` is an auto-generated image tag, which depends on source code in [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
The `<PKG_TAG>` may be manually set via `PKG_TAG=foobar make package-vmagent`.

The base docker image is [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) but it is possible to use any other base image
by setting it via `<ROOT_IMAGE>` environment variable. For example, the following command builds the image on top of [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) image:

```console
ROOT_IMAGE=scratch make package-vmagent
```

### ARM build

ARM build may run on Raspberry Pi or on [energy-efficient ARM servers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/arm-takes-wing/).

### Development ARM build

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install). The minimum supported version is Go 1.19.
1. Run `make vmagent-linux-arm` or `make vmagent-linux-arm64` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics)
   It builds `vmagent-linux-arm` or `vmagent-linux-arm64` binary respectively and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Production ARM build

1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
1. Run `make vmagent-linux-arm-prod` or `make vmagent-linux-arm64-prod` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds `vmagent-linux-arm-prod` or `vmagent-linux-arm64-prod` binary respectively and puts it into the `bin` folder.

## Profiling

`vmagent` provides handlers for collecting the following [Go profiles](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs):

* Memory profile can be collected with the following command (replace `0.0.0.0` with hostname if needed):

<div class="with-copy" markdown="1">

```console
curl http://0.0.0.0:8429/debug/pprof/heap > mem.pprof
```

</div>

* CPU profile can be collected with the following command (replace `0.0.0.0` with hostname if needed):

<div class="with-copy" markdown="1">

```console
curl http://0.0.0.0:8429/debug/pprof/profile > cpu.pprof
```

</div>

The command for collecting CPU profile waits for 30 seconds before returning.

The collected profiles may be analyzed with [go tool pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof).

It is safe sharing the collected profiles from security point of view, since they do not contain sensitive information.

## Advanced usage

`vmagent` can be fine-tuned with various command-line flags. Run `./vmagent -help` in order to see the full list of these flags with their descriptions and default values:

```
./vmagent -help

vmagent collects metrics data via popular data ingestion protocols and routes them to VictoriaMetrics.

See the docs at https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html .

  -cacheExpireDuration duration
     Items are removed from in-memory caches after they aren't accessed for this duration. Lower values may reduce memory usage at the cost of higher CPU usage. See also -prevCacheRemovalPercent (default 30m0s)

The following files are checked: -promscrape.config, -remoteWrite.relabelConfig, -remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig, -remoteWrite.streamAggr.config . Unknown config entries aren't allowed in -promscrape.config by default. This can be changed by passing -promscrape.config.strictParse=false command-line flag
  -enableTCP6
     Whether to enable IPv6 for listening and dialing. By default, only IPv4 TCP and UDP are used
  -envflag.enable
     Whether to enable reading flags from environment variables in addition to the command line. Command line flag values have priority over values from environment vars. Flags are read only from the command line if this flag isn't set. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#environment-variables for more details
  -envflag.prefix string
     Prefix for environment variables if -envflag.enable is set

     The maximum duration for a graceful shutdown of the HTTP server. A highly loaded server may require increased value for a graceful shutdown (default 7s)
  -http.pathPrefix string
     An optional prefix to add to all the paths handled by http server. For example, if '-http.pathPrefix=/foo/bar' is set, then all the http requests will be handled on '/foo/bar/*' paths. This may be useful for proxied requests. See https://www.robustperception.io/using-external-urls-and-proxies-with-prometheus
  -http.shutdownDelay duration
     Optional delay before http server shutdown. During this delay, the server returns non-OK responses from /health page, so load balancers can route new requests to other servers
  -httpAuth.password string
     Password for HTTP server's Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if -httpAuth.username is empty
  -httpAuth.username string
     Username for HTTP server's Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if empty. See also -httpAuth.password
  -httpListenAddr string
     TCP address to listen for http connections. Set this flag to empty value in order to disable listening on any port.

  -influxSkipMeasurement
     Uses '{field_name}' as a metric name while ignoring '{measurement}' and '-influxMeasurementFieldSeparator'
  -influxSkipSingleField
     Uses '{measurement}' instead of '{measurement}{separator}{field_name}' for metric name if InfluxDB line contains only a single field
  -influxTrimTimestamp duration
     Trim timestamps for InfluxDB line protocol data to this duration. Minimum practical duration is 1ms. Higher duration (i.e. 1s) may be used for reducing disk space usage for timestamp data (default 1ms)

     Optional TLS server name to use for connections to the corresponding -remoteWrite.url. By default, the server name from -remoteWrite.url is used
     Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.tmpDataPath string
     Path to directory where temporary data for remote write component is stored. See also -remoteWrite.maxDiskUsagePerURL (default "vmagent-remotewrite-data")
  -remoteWrite.url array
     Remote storage URL to write data to. It must support either VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol or Prometheus remote_write protocol. Example url: http://<victoriametrics-host>:8428/api/v1/write . Pass multiple -remoteWrite.url options in order to replicate the collected data to multiple remote storage systems. The data can be sharded among the configured remote storage systems if -remoteWrite.shardByURL flag is set. See also -remoteWrite.multitenantURL
     Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig array
     Optional path to relabel configs for the corresponding -remoteWrite.url. See also -remoteWrite.relabelConfig. The path can point either to local file or to http url. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#relabeling
     Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.vmProtoCompressLevel int
     The compression level for VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol. Higher values reduce network traffic at the cost of higher CPU usage. Negative values reduce CPU usage at the cost of increased network traffic. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#victoriametrics-remote-write-protocol
  -sortLabels
     Whether to sort labels for incoming samples before writing them to all the configured remote storage systems. This may be needed for reducing memory usage at remote storage when the order of labels in incoming samples is random. For example, if m{k1="v1",k2="v2"} may be sent as m{k2="v2",k1="v1"}Enabled sorting for labels can slow down ingestion performance a bit
  -tls
     Whether to enable TLS for incoming HTTP requests at -httpListenAddr (aka https). -tlsCertFile and -tlsKeyFile must be set if -tls is set
  -tlsCertFile string
     Path to file with TLS certificate if -tls is set. Prefer ECDSA certs instead of RSA certs as RSA certs are slower. The provided certificate file is automatically re-read every second, so it can be dynamically updated
  -tlsCipherSuites array
     Optional list of TLS cipher suites for incoming requests over HTTPS if -tls is set. See the list of supported cipher suites at https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/tls#pkg-constants
     Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -tlsKeyFile string
     Path to file with TLS key if -tls is set. The provided key file is automatically re-read every second, so it can be dynamically updated
  -tlsMinVersion string
     Optional minimum TLS version to use for incoming requests over HTTPS if -tls is set. Supported values: TLS10, TLS11, TLS12, TLS13
  -usePromCompatibleNaming
     Whether to replace characters unsupported by Prometheus with underscores in the ingested metric names and label names. For example, foo.bar{a.b='c'} is transformed into foo_bar{a_b='c'} during data ingestion if this flag is set. See https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels
  -version
     Show VictoriaMetrics version
