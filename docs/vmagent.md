# vmagent

`vmagent` is a tiny but mighty agent which helps you collect metrics from various sources
and store them in [VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics)
or any other Prometheus-compatible storage systems that support the `remote_write` protocol.

<img alt="vmagent" src="vmagent.png">


## Motivation

While VictoriaMetrics provides an efficient solution to store and observe metrics, our users needed something fast
and RAM friendly to scrape metrics from Prometheus-compatible exporters into VictoriaMetrics.
Also, we found that our user's infrastructure are like snowflakes in that no two are alike. Therefore we decided to add more flexibility
to `vmagent` such as the ability to push metrics instead of pulling them. We did our best and will continue to improve vmagent.


## Features

* Can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus for scraping targets such as [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter).
  See [Quick Start](#quick-start) for details.
* Can add, remove and modify labels (aka tags) via Prometheus relabeling. Can filter data before sending it to remote storage. See [these docs](#relabeling) for details.
* Accepts data via all ingestion protocols supported by VictoriaMetrics:
  * Influx line protocol via `http://<vmagent>:8429/write`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-send-data-from-influxdb-compatible-agents-such-as-telegraf).
  * Graphite plaintext protocol if `-graphiteListenAddr` command-line flag is set. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-send-data-from-graphite-compatible-agents-such-as-statsd).
  * OpenTSDB telnet and http protocols if `-opentsdbListenAddr` command-line flag is set. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-send-data-from-opentsdb-compatible-agents).
  * Prometheus remote write protocol via `http://<vmagent>:8429/api/v1/write`.
  * JSON lines import protocol via `http://<vmagent>:8429/api/v1/import`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-import-data-in-json-line-format).
  * Native data import protocol via `http://<vmagent>:8429/api/v1/import/native`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-import-data-in-native-format).
  * Data in Prometheus exposition format. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-import-data-in-prometheus-exposition-format) for details.
  * Arbitrary CSV data via `http://<vmagent>:8429/api/v1/import/csv`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-import-csv-data).
* Can replicate collected metrics simultaneously to multiple remote storage systems.
* Works smoothly in environments with unstable connections to remote storage. If the remote storage is unavailable, the collected metrics
  are buffered at `-remoteWrite.tmpDataPath`. The buffered metrics are sent to remote storage as soon as the connection
  to the remote storage is repaired. The maximum disk usage for the buffer can be limited with `-remoteWrite.maxDiskUsagePerURL`.
* Uses lower amounts of RAM, CPU, disk IO and network bandwidth compared with Prometheus.
* Scrape targets can be spread among multiple `vmagent` instances when big number of targets must be scraped. See [these docs](#scraping-big-number-of-targets).
* Can efficiently scrape targets that expose millions of time series such as [/federate endpoint in Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/). See [these docs](#stream-parsing-mode).
* Can deal with high cardinality and high churn rate issues by limiting the number of unique time series sent to remote storage systems. See [these docs](#cardinality-limiter).


## Quick Start

Please download `vmutils-*` archive from [releases page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases), unpack it
and configure the following flags to the `vmagent` binary in order to start scraping Prometheus targets:

* `-promscrape.config` with the path to Prometheus config file (usually located at `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`)
* `-remoteWrite.url` with the remote storage endpoint such as VictoriaMetrics, the `-remoteWrite.url` argument can be specified multiple times to replicate data concurrently to an arbitrary number of remote storage systems.

Example command line:

```
/path/to/vmagent -promscrape.config=/path/to/prometheus.yml -remoteWrite.url=https://victoria-metrics-host:8428/api/v1/write
```

If you only need to collect Influx data, then the following command is sufficient:

```
/path/to/vmagent -remoteWrite.url=https://victoria-metrics-host:8428/api/v1/write
```

Then send Influx data to `http://vmagent-host:8429`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-send-data-from-influxdb-compatible-agents-such-as-telegraf) for more details.

`vmagent` is also available in [docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/vmagent/tags).

Pass `-help` to `vmagent` in order to see [the full list of supported command-line flags with their descriptions](#advanced-usage).


## Configuration update

`vmagent` should be restarted in order to update config options set via command-line args.

`vmagent` supports multiple approaches for reloading configs from updated config files such as `-promscrape.config`, `-remoteWrite.relabelConfig` and `-remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig`:

* Sending `SUGHUP` signal to `vmagent` process:
  ```bash
  kill -SIGHUP `pidof vmagent`
  ```

* Sending HTTP request to `http://vmagent:8429/-/reload` endpoint.

There is also `-promscrape.configCheckInterval` command-line option, which can be used for automatic reloading configs from updated `-promscrape.config` file.


## Use cases


### IoT and Edge monitoring

`vmagent` can run and collect metrics in IoT and industrial networks with unreliable or scheduled connections to their remote storage.
It buffers the collected data in local files until the connection to remote storage becomes available and then sends the buffered
data to the remote storage. It re-tries sending the data to remote storage until any errors are resolved.
The maximum buffer size can be limited with `-remoteWrite.maxDiskUsagePerURL`.

`vmagent` works on various architectures from the IoT world - 32-bit arm, 64-bit arm, ppc64, 386, amd64.
See [the corresponding Makefile rules](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmagent/Makefile) for details.


### Drop-in replacement for Prometheus

If you use Prometheus only for scraping metrics from various targets and forwarding those metrics to remote storage
then `vmagent` can replace Prometheus. Typically, `vmagent` requires lower amounts of RAM, CPU and network bandwidth compared with Prometheus.
See [these docs](#how-to-collect-metrics-in-prometheus-format) for details.


### Replication and high availability

`vmagent` replicates the collected metrics among multiple remote storage instances configured via `-remoteWrite.url` args.
If a single remote storage instance temporarily is out of service, then the collected data remains available in another remote storage instance.
`vmagent` buffers the collected data in files at `-remoteWrite.tmpDataPath` until the remote storage becomes available again and then it sends the buffered data to the remote storage in order to prevent data gaps.


### Relabeling and filtering

`vmagent` can add, remove or update labels on the collected data before sending it to the remote storage. Additionally,
it can remove unwanted samples via Prometheus-like relabeling before sending the collected data to remote storage.
Please see [these docs](#relabeling) for details.


### Splitting data streams among multiple systems

`vmagent` supports splitting the collected data between muliple destinations with the help of `-remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig`,
which is applied independently for each configured `-remoteWrite.url` destination. For example, it is possible to replicate or split
data among long-term remote storage, short-term remote storage and a real-time analytical system [built on top of Kafka](https://github.com/Telefonica/prometheus-kafka-adapter).
Note that each destination can receive it's own subset of the collected data due to per-destination relabeling via `-remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig`.


### Prometheus remote_write proxy

`vmagent` can be used as a proxy for Prometheus data sent via Prometheus `remote_write` protocol. It can accept data via the `remote_write` API
at the`/api/v1/write` endpoint. Then apply relabeling and filtering and proxy it to another `remote_write` system .
The `vmagent` can be configured to encrypt the incoming `remote_write` requests with `-tls*` command-line flags.
Also, Basic Auth can be enabled for the incoming `remote_write` requests with `-httpAuth.*` command-line flags.


### remote_write for clustered version

While `vmagent` can accept data in several supported protocols (OpenTSDB, Influx, Prometheus, Graphite) and scrape data from various targets, writes are always peformed in Promethes remote_write protocol. Therefore for the [clustered version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html), `-remoteWrite.url` the command-line flag should be configured as `<schema>://<vminsert-host>:8480/insert/<customer-id>/prometheus/api/v1/write`


## How to collect metrics in Prometheus format

Specify the path to `prometheus.yml` file via `-promscrape.config` command-line flag. `vmagent` takes into account the following
sections from [Prometheus config file](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/):

* `global`
* `scrape_configs`

All other sections are ignored, including the [remote_write](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write) section.
Use `-remoteWrite.*` command-line flag instead for configuring remote write settings.

The following scrape types in [scrape_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config) section are supported:

* `static_configs` - is for scraping statically defined targets. See [these docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#static_config) for details.
* `file_sd_configs` - is for scraping targets defined in external files (aka file-based service discover).
  See [these docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#file_sd_config) for details
* `kubernetes_sd_configs` - for scraping targets in Kubernetes (k8s).
  See [kubernetes_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config) for details.
* `ec2_sd_configs` - is for scraping targets in Amazon EC2.
  See [ec2_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#ec2_sd_config) for details.
  `vmagent` doesn't support the `profile` config param yet.
* `gce_sd_configs` - is for scraping targets in Google Compute Engine (GCE).
  See [gce_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#gce_sd_config) for details.
  `vmagent` provides the following additional functionality for `gce_sd_config`:
  * if `project` arg is missing then `vmagent` uses the project for the instance where it runs;
  * if `zone` arg is missing then `vmagent` uses the zone for the instance where it runs;
  * if `zone` arg is equal to `"*"`, then `vmagent` discovers all the zones for the given project;
  * `zone` may contain an arbitrary number of zones, i.e. `zone: [us-east1-a, us-east1-b]`.
* `consul_sd_configs` - is for scraping the targets registered in Consul.
  See [consul_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#consul_sd_config) for details.
* `dns_sd_configs` - is for scraping targets discovered from DNS records (SRV, A and AAAA).
  See [dns_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#dns_sd_config) for details.
* `openstack_sd_configs` - is for scraping OpenStack targets.
  See [openstack_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#openstack_sd_config) for details.
  [OpenStack identity API v3](https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3/) is supported only.
* `docker_sd_configs` - is for scraping Docker targets.
  See [docker_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#docker_sd_config) for details.
* `dockerswarm_sd_configs` - is for scraping Docker Swarm targets.
  See [dockerswarm_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#dockerswarm_sd_config) for details.
* `eureka_sd_configs` - is for scraping targets registered in [Netflix Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka).
  See [eureka_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#eureka_sd_config) for details.
* `digitalocean_sd_configs` is for scraping targerts registered in [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
  See [digitalocean_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#digitalocean_sd_config) for details.
* `http_sd_configs` is for scraping targerts registered in http service discovery.
  See [http_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#http_sd_config) for details.

Please file feature requests to [our issue tracker](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues) if you need other service discovery mechanisms to be supported by `vmagent`.

`vmagent` also support the following additional options in `scrape_configs` section:

* `disable_compression: true` - to disable response compression on a per-job basis. By default `vmagent` requests compressed responses from scrape targets
  to save network bandwidth.
* `disable_keepalive: true` - to disable [HTTP keep-alive connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection) on a per-job basis.
  By default, `vmagent` uses keep-alive connections to scrape targets to reduce overhead on connection re-establishing.
* `stream_parse: true` - for scraping targets in a streaming manner. This may be useful for targets exporting big number of metrics. See [these docs](#stream-parsing-mode).

Note that `vmagent` doesn't support `refresh_interval` option for these scrape configs. Use the corresponding `-promscrape.*CheckInterval`
command-line flag instead. For example, `-promscrape.consulSDCheckInterval=60s` sets `refresh_interval` for all the `consul_sd_configs`
entries to 60s. Run `vmagent -help` in order to see default values for the `-promscrape.*CheckInterval` flags.

The file pointed by `-promscrape.config` may contain `%{ENV_VAR}` placeholders which are substituted by the corresponding `ENV_VAR` environment variable values.


## Adding labels to metrics

Labels can be added to metrics by the following mechanisms:

* The `global -> external_labels` section in `-promscrape.config` file. These labels are added only to metrics scraped from targets configured in the `-promscrape.config` file. They aren't added to metrics collected via other [data ingestion protocols](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-import-time-series-data).
* The `-remoteWrite.label` command-line flag. These labels are added to all the collected metrics before sending them to `-remoteWrite.url`. For example, the following command will start `vmagent`, which will add `{datacenter="foobar"}` label to all the metrics pushed to all the configured remote storage systems (all the `-remoteWrite.url` flag values):

```
/path/to/vmagent -remoteWrite.label=datacenter=foobar ...
```


## Relabeling

`vmagent` supports [Prometheus relabeling](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config).
and also provides the following actions:

* `replace_all`: replaces all of the occurences of `regex` in the values of `source_labels` with the `replacement` and stores the results in the `target_label`.
* `labelmap_all`: replaces all of the occurences of `regex` in all the label names with the `replacement`.
* `keep_if_equal`: keeps the entry if all the label values from `source_labels` are equal.
* `drop_if_equal`: drops the entry if all the label values from `source_labels` are equal.

The relabeling can be defined in the following places:

* At the `scrape_config -> relabel_configs` section in `-promscrape.config` file. This relabeling is applied to target labels. This relabeling can be debugged by passing `relabel_debug: true` option to the corresponding `scrape_config` section. In this case `vmagent` logs target labels before and after the relabeling and then drops the logged target.
* At the `scrape_config -> metric_relabel_configs` section in `-promscrape.config` file. This relabeling is applied to all the scraped metrics in the given `scrape_config`. This relabeling can be debugged by passing `metric_relabel_debug: true` option to the corresponding `scrape_config` section. In this case `vmagent` logs metrics before and after the relabeling and then drops the logged metrics.
* At the `-remoteWrite.relabelConfig` file. This relabeling is aplied to all the collected metrics before sending them to remote storage. This relabeling can be debugged by passing `-remoteWrite.relabelDebug` command-line option to `vmagent`. In this case `vmagent` logs metrics before and after the relabeling and then drops all the logged metrics instead of sending them to remote storage.
* At the `-remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig` files. This relabeling is applied to metrics before sending them to the corresponding `-remoteWrite.url`. This relabeling can be debugged by passing `-remoteWrite.urlRelabelDebug` command-line options to `vmagent`. In this case `vmagent` logs metrics before and after the relabeling and then drops all the logged metrics instead of sending them to the corresponding `-remoteWrite.url`.

## Stream parsing mode

By default `vmagent` reads the full response from scrape target into memory, then parses it, applies [relabeling](#relabeling) and then pushes the resulting metrics to the configured `-remoteWrite.url`. This mode works good for the majority of cases when the scrape target exposes small number of metrics (e.g. less than 10 thousand). But this mode may take big amounts of memory when the scrape target exposes big number of metrics. In this case it is recommended enabling stream parsing mode. When this mode is enabled, then `vmagent` reads response from scrape target in chunks, then immediately processes every chunk and pushes the processed metrics to remote storage. This allows saving memory when scraping targets that expose millions of metrics. Stream parsing mode may be enabled either globally for all of the scrape targets by passing `-promscrape.streamParse` command-line flag or on a per-scrape target basis with `stream_parse: true` option. For example:

  ```yml
  scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'big-federate'
    stream_parse: true
    static_configs:
    - targets:
      - big-prometeus1
      - big-prometeus2
    honor_labels: true
    metrics_path: /federate
    params:
      'match[]': ['{__name__!=""}']
  ```

Note that `sample_limit` option doesn't prevent from data push to remote storage if stream parsing is enabled because the parsed data is pushed to remote storage as soon as it is parsed.


## Scraping big number of targets

A single `vmagent` instance can scrape tens of thousands of scrape targets. Sometimes this isn't enough due to limitations on CPU, network, RAM, etc.
In this case scrape targets can be split among multiple `vmagent` instances (aka `vmagent` horizontal scaling, sharding and clustering).
Each `vmagent` instance in the cluster must use identical `-promscrape.config` files with distinct `-promscrape.cluster.memberNum` values.
The flag value must be in the range `0 ... N-1`, where `N` is the number of `vmagent` instances in the cluster.
The number of `vmagent` instances in the cluster must be passed to `-promscrape.cluster.membersCount` command-line flag. For example, the following commands
spread scrape targets among a cluster of two `vmagent` instances:

```
/path/to/vmagent -promscrape.cluster.membersCount=2 -promscrape.cluster.memberNum=0 -promscrape.config=/path/to/config.yml ...
/path/to/vmagent -promscrape.cluster.membersCount=2 -promscrape.cluster.memberNum=1 -promscrape.config=/path/to/config.yml ...
```

By default each scrape target is scraped only by a single `vmagent` instance in the cluster. If there is a need for replicating scrape targets among multiple `vmagent` instances,
then `-promscrape.cluster.replicationFactor` command-line flag must be set to the desired number of replicas. For example, the following commands
start a cluster of three `vmagent` instances, where each target is scraped by two `vmagent` instances:

```
/path/to/vmagent -promscrape.cluster.membersCount=3 -promscrape.cluster.replicationFactor=2 -promscrape.cluster.memberNum=0 -promscrape.config=/path/to/config.yml ...
/path/to/vmagent -promscrape.cluster.membersCount=3 -promscrape.cluster.replicationFactor=2 -promscrape.cluster.memberNum=1 -promscrape.config=/path/to/config.yml ...
/path/to/vmagent -promscrape.cluster.membersCount=3 -promscrape.cluster.replicationFactor=2 -promscrape.cluster.memberNum=2 -promscrape.config=/path/to/config.yml ...
```

If each target is scraped by multiple `vmagent` instances, then data deduplication must be enabled at remote storage pointed by `-remoteWrite.url`.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#deduplication) for details.


## Scraping targets via a proxy

`vmagent` supports scraping targets via http, https and socks5 proxies. Proxy address must be specified in `proxy_url` option. For example, the following scrape config instructs
target scraping via https proxy at `https://proxy-addr:1234`:

```yml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: foo
  proxy_url: https://proxy-addr:1234
```

Proxy can be configured with the following optional settings:

* `proxy_authorization` for generic token authorization. See [Prometheus docs for details on authorization section](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config)
* `proxy_bearer_token` and `proxy_bearer_token_file` for Bearer token authorization
* `proxy_basic_auth` for Basic authorization. See [these docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config).
* `proxy_tls_config` for TLS config. See [these docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#tls_config).

For example:

```yml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: foo
  proxy_url: https://proxy-addr:1234
  proxy_basic_auth:
    username: foobar
    password: secret
  proxy_tls_config:
    insecure_skip_verify: true
    cert_file: /path/to/cert
    key_file: /path/to/key
    ca_file: /path/to/ca
    server_name: real-server-name
```

## Cardinality limiter

By default `vmagent` doesn't limit the number of time series written to remote storage systems specified at `-remoteWrite.url`. The limit can be enforced by setting the following command-line flags:

* `-remoteWrite.maxHourlySeries` - limits the number of unique time series `vmagent` can write to remote storage systems during the last hour. Useful for limiting the number of active time series.
* `-remoteWrite.maxDailySeries` - limits the number of unique time series `vmagent` can write to remote storage systems during the last day. Useful for limiting daily churn rate.

Both limits can be set simultaneously. If any of these limits is reached, then samples for new time series are dropped instead of sending them to remote storage systems. A sample of dropped series is put in the log with `WARNING` level.

The exceeded limits can be [monitored](#monitoring) with the following metrics:

* `vmagent_hourly_series_limit_rows_dropped_total` - the number of metrics dropped due to exceeded hourly limit on the number of unique time series.
* `vmagent_daily_series_limit_rows_dropped_total` - the number of metrics dropped due to exceeded daily limit on the number of unique time series.

These limits are approximate, so `vmagent` can underflow/overflow the limit by a small percentage (usually less than 1%).


## Monitoring

`vmagent` exports various metrics in Prometheus exposition format at `http://vmagent-host:8429/metrics` page. We recommend setting up regular scraping of this page
either through `vmagent` itself or by Prometheus so that the exported metrics may be analyzed later.
Use official [Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12683) for `vmagent` state overview.
If you have suggestions for improvements or have found a bug - please open an issue on github or add a review to the dashboard.

`vmagent` also exports the status for various targets at the following handlers:

* `http://vmagent-host:8429/targets`. This handler returns human-readable status for every active target.
This page is easy to query from the command line with `wget`, `curl` or similar tools.
It accepts optional `show_original_labels=1` query arg which shows the original labels per each target before applying the relabeling.
This information may be useful for debugging target relabeling.
* `http://vmagent-host:8429/api/v1/targets`. This handler returns data compatible with [the corresponding page from Prometheus API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#targets).

* `http://vmagent-host:8429/ready`. This handler returns http 200 status code when `vmagent` finishes it's initialization for all service_discovery configs.
It may be useful to perform `vmagent` rolling update without any scrape loss.


## Troubleshooting

* We recommend you [set up the official Grafana dashboard](#monitoring) in order to monitor the state of `vmagent'.

* We recommend you increase the maximum number of open files in the system (`ulimit -n`) when scraping a big number of targets,
  as `vmagent` establishes at least a single TCP connection per target.

* If `vmagent` uses too big amounts of memory, then the following options can help:
  * Enabling stream parsing. See [these docs](#stream-parsing-mode).
  * Reducing the number of output queues with `-remoteWrite.queues` command-line option.
  * Reducing the amounts of RAM vmagent can use for in-memory buffering with `-memory.allowedPercent` or `-memory.allowedBytes` command-line option. Another option is to reduce memory limits in Docker and/or Kuberntes if `vmagent` runs under these systems.
  * Reducing the number of CPU cores vmagent can use by passing `GOMAXPROCS=N` environment variable to `vmagent`, where `N` is the desired limit on CPU cores. Another option is to reduce CPU limits in Docker or Kubernetes if `vmagent` runs under these systems.

* When `vmagent` scrapes many unreliable targets, it can flood the error log with scrape errors. These errors can be suppressed
  by passing `-promscrape.suppressScrapeErrors` command-line flag to `vmagent`. The most recent scrape error per each target can be observed at `http://vmagent-host:8429/targets`
  and `http://vmagent-host:8429/api/v1/targets`.

* The `/api/v1/targets` page could be useful for debugging relabeling process for scrape targets.
  This page contains original labels for targets dropped during relabeling (see "droppedTargets" section in the page output). By default the `-promscrape.maxDroppedTargets` targets are shown here. If your setup drops more targets during relabeling, then increase `-promscrape.maxDroppedTargets` command-line flag value to see all the dropped targets. Note that tracking each dropped target requires up to 10Kb of RAM. Therefore big values for `-promscrape.maxDroppedTargets` may result in increased memory usage if a big number of scrape targets are dropped during relabeling.

* If `vmagent` scrapes a big number of targets then the `-promscrape.dropOriginalLabels` command-line option may be passed to `vmagent` in order to reduce memory usage.
  This option drops `"discoveredLabels"` and `"droppedTargets"` lists at `/api/v1/targets` page, which may result in reduced debuggability for improperly configured per-target relabeling.

* If `vmagent` scrapes targets with millions of metrics per target (for example, when scraping [federation endpoints](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/)),
  we recommend enabling [stream parsing mode](#stream-parsing-mode) in order to reduce memory usage during scraping.

* We recommend you increase `-remoteWrite.queues` if `vmagent_remotewrite_pending_data_bytes` metric exported at `http://vmagent-host:8429/metrics` page grows constantly.

* If you see gaps in the data pushed by `vmagent` to remote storage when `-remoteWrite.maxDiskUsagePerURL` is set, try increasing `-remoteWrite.queues`.
  Such gaps may appear because `vmagent` cannot keep up with sending the collected data to remote storage. Therefore it starts dropping the buffered data
  if the on-disk buffer size exceeds `-remoteWrite.maxDiskUsagePerURL`.

* `vmagent` drops data blocks if remote storage replies with `400 Bad Request` and `409 Conflict` HTTP responses. The number of dropped blocks can be monitored via `vmagent_remotewrite_packets_dropped_total` metric exported at [/metrics page](#monitoring).

* Use `-remoteWrite.queues=1` when `-remoteWrite.url` points to remote storage, which doesn't accept out-of-order samples (aka data backfilling). Such storage systems include Prometheus, Cortex and Thanos.

* `vmagent` buffers scraped data at the `-remoteWrite.tmpDataPath` directory until it is sent to `-remoteWrite.url`.
  The directory can grow large when remote storage is unavailable for extended periods of time and if `-remoteWrite.maxDiskUsagePerURL` isn't set.
  If you don't want to send all the data from the directory to remote storage then simply stop `vmagent` and delete the directory.

* By default `vmagent` masks `-remoteWrite.url` with `secret-url` values in logs and at `/metrics` page because
  the url may contain sensitive information such as auth tokens or passwords.
  Pass `-remoteWrite.showURL` command-line flag when starting `vmagent` in order to see all the valid urls.

* By default `vmagent` evenly spreads scrape load in time. If a particular scrape target must be scraped at the beginning of some interval,
  then `scrape_align_interval` option  must be used. For example, the following config aligns hourly scrapes to the beginning of hour:

  ```yml
  scrape_configs:
  - job_name: foo
    scrape_interval: 1h
    scrape_align_interval: 1h
  ```

* By default `vmagent` evenly spreads scrape load in time. If a particular scrape target must be scraped at specific offset, then `scrape_offset` option must be used.
  For example, the following config instructs `vmagent` to scrape the target at 10 seconds of every minute:

  ```yml
  scrape_configs:
  - job_name: foo
    scrape_interval: 1m
    scrape_offset: 10s
  ```

* If you see `skipping duplicate scrape target with identical labels` errors when scraping Kubernetes pods, then it is likely these pods listen to multiple ports
  or they use an init container. These errors can either be fixed or suppressed with the `-promscrape.suppressDuplicateScrapeTargetErrors` command-line flag.
  See the available options below if you prefer fixing the root cause of the error:

  The following relabeling rule may be added to `relabel_configs` section in order to filter out pods with unneeded ports:
  ```yml
  - action: keep_if_equal
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_port, __meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_number]
  ```

  The following relabeling rule may be added to `relabel_configs` section in order to filter out init container pods:
  ```yml
  - action: drop
    source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_init]
    regex: true
  ```


## How to build from sources

We recommend using [binary releases](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases) - `vmagent` is located in the `vmutils-*` archives .


### Development build

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install). The minimum supported version is Go 1.16.
2. Run `make vmagent` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds the `vmagent` binary and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Production build

1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
2. Run `make vmagent-prod` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds `vmagent-prod` binary and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Building docker images

Run `make package-vmagent`. It builds `victoriametrics/vmagent:<PKG_TAG>` docker image locally.
`<PKG_TAG>` is an auto-generated image tag, which depends on source code in [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
The `<PKG_TAG>` may be manually set via `PKG_TAG=foobar make package-vmagent`.

The base docker image is [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) but it is possible to use any other base image
by setting it via `<ROOT_IMAGE>` environment variable. For example, the following command builds the image on top of [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) image:

```bash
ROOT_IMAGE=scratch make package-vmagent
```

### ARM build

ARM build may run on Raspberry Pi or on [energy-efficient ARM servers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/arm-takes-wing/).

### Development ARM build

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install). The minimum supported version is Go 1.16.
2. Run `make vmagent-arm` or `make vmagent-arm64` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics)
   It builds `vmagent-arm` or `vmagent-arm64` binary respectively and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Production ARM build

1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
2. Run `make vmagent-arm-prod` or `make vmagent-arm64-prod` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds `vmagent-arm-prod` or `vmagent-arm64-prod` binary respectively and puts it into the `bin` folder.


## Profiling

`vmagent` provides handlers for collecting the following [Go profiles](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs):

* Memory profile can be collected with the following command:

```bash
curl -s http://<vmagent-host>:8429/debug/pprof/heap > mem.pprof
```

* CPU profile can be collected with the following command:

```bash
curl -s http://<vmagent-host>:8429/debug/pprof/profile > cpu.pprof
```

The command for collecting CPU profile waits for 30 seconds before returning.

The collected profiles may be analyzed with [go tool pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof).


## Advanced usage

`vmagent` can be fine-tuned with various command-line flags. Run `./vmagent -help` in order to see the full list of these flags with their desciptions and default values:

```
./vmagent -help

vmagent collects metrics data via popular data ingestion protocols and routes them to VictoriaMetrics.

See the docs at https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html .

Examples: -remoteWrite.roundDigits=2 would round 1.236 to 1.24, while -remoteWrite.roundDigits=-1 would round 126.78 to 130. By default digits rounding is disabled. Set it to 100 for disabling it for a particular remote storage. This option may be used for improving data compression for the stored metrics
    	Supports array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.sendTimeout array
    	Timeout for sending a single block of data to -remoteWrite.url
    	Supports array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.showURL
    	Whether to show -remoteWrite.url in the exported metrics. It is hidden by default, since it can contain sensitive info such as auth key
  -remoteWrite.significantFigures array
    	The number of significant figures to leave in metric values before writing them to remote storage. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures . Zero value saves all the significant figures. This option may be used for improving data compression for the stored metrics. See also -remoteWrite.roundDigits
    	Supports array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.tlsCAFile array
    	Optional path to TLS CA file to use for verifying connections to -remoteWrite.url. By default system CA is used. If multiple args are set, then they are applied independently for the corresponding -remoteWrite.url
    	Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.tlsCertFile array
    	Optional path to client-side TLS certificate file to use when connecting to -remoteWrite.url. If multiple args are set, then they are applied independently for the corresponding -remoteWrite.url
    	Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.tlsInsecureSkipVerify array
    	Whether to skip tls verification when connecting to -remoteWrite.url
    	Supports array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.tlsKeyFile array
    	Optional path to client-side TLS certificate key to use when connecting to -remoteWrite.url. If multiple args are set, then they are applied independently for the corresponding -remoteWrite.url
    	Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.tlsServerName array
    	Optional TLS server name to use for connections to -remoteWrite.url. By default the server name from -remoteWrite.url is used. If multiple args are set, then they are applied independently for the corresponding -remoteWrite.url
    	Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.tmpDataPath string
    	Path to directory where temporary data for remote write component is stored. See also -remoteWrite.maxDiskUsagePerURL (default "vmagent-remotewrite-data")
  -remoteWrite.url array
    	Remote storage URL to write data to. It must support Prometheus remote_write API. It is recommended using VictoriaMetrics as remote storage. Example url: http://<victoriametrics-host>:8428/api/v1/write . Pass multiple -remoteWrite.url flags in order to write data concurrently to multiple remote storage systems
    	Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig array
    	Optional path to relabel config for the corresponding -remoteWrite.url
    	Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -remoteWrite.urlRelabelDebug array
    	Whether to log metrics before and after relabeling with -remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig. If the -remoteWrite.urlRelabelDebug is enabled, then the metrics aren't sent to the corresponding -remoteWrite.url. This is useful for debugging the relabeling configs
    	Supports array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
  -sortLabels
    	Whether to sort labels for incoming samples before writing them to all the configured remote storage systems. This may be needed for reducing memory usage at remote storage when the order of labels in incoming samples is random. For example, if m{k1="v1",k2="v2"} may be sent as m{k2="v2",k1="v1"}Enabled sorting for labels can slow down ingestion performance a bit
  -tls
    	Whether to enable TLS (aka HTTPS) for incoming requests. -tlsCertFile and -tlsKeyFile must be set if -tls is set
  -tlsCertFile string
    	Path to file with TLS certificate. Used only if -tls is set. Prefer ECDSA certs instead of RSA certs as RSA certs are slower
  -tlsKeyFile string
    	Path to file with TLS key. Used only if -tls is set
  -version
    	Show VictoriaMetrics version
```
