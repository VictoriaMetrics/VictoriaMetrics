# VMStaticScrape

The `VMStaticScrape` CRD provides mechanism for scraping metrics from static targets, configured by CRD targets.

`VMStaticScrape` object generates part of [VMAgent](./vmagent.md) 
configuration with [static "service discovery"](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#static_configs).
It has various options for scraping configuration of target (with basic auth,tls access, by specific port name etc.).

By specifying configuration at CRD, operator generates config 
for [VMAgent](./vmagent.md) and syncs it. 
It's useful for external targets management, when service-discovery is not available. 
`VMAgent` `staticScrapeSelector` must match `VMStaticScrape` labels.

More information about selectors you can find in [this doc](./vmagent.md#scraping).
