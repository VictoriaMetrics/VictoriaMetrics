# VMCluster

`VMCluster` represents a high-available and fault-tolerant version of VictoriaMetrics database.
The `VMCluster` CRD defines a [cluster version VM](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html).

For each `VMCluster` resource, the Operator creates:

- `VMStorage` as `StatefulSet`,
- `VMSelect` as `StatefulSet`
- and `VMInsert` as deployment.

For `VMStorage` and `VMSelect` headless  services are created. `VMInsert` is created as service with clusterIP.

There is a strict order for these objects creation and reconciliation:

1. `VMStorage` is synced - the Operator waits until all its pods are ready;
1. Then it syncs `VMSelect` with the same manner;
1. `VMInsert` is the last object to sync.

All [statefulsets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) are created 
with [OnDelete](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#on-delete) update type. 
It allows to manually manage the rolling update process for Operator by deleting pods one by one and waiting for the ready status.

Rolling update process may be configured by the operator env variables.
The most important is `VM_PODWAITREADYTIMEOUT=80s` - it controls how long to wait for pod's ready status.

## Specification

You can see the full actual specification of the `VMCluster` resource in the **[API docs -> VMCluster](../api.md#vmcluster)**.

If you can't find necessary field in the specification of the custom resource,
see [Extra arguments section](./README.md#extra-arguments).

Also, you can check out the [examples](#examples) section.

## High availability

The cluster version provides a full set of high availability features - metrics replication, node failover, horizontal scaling.

First, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the high availability tools provided by "VictoriaMetrics Cluster" itself:

- [High availability](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#high-availability),
- [Cluster availability](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#cluster-availability),
- [Replication and data safety](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#replication-and-data-safety).

`VMCluster` supports all listed in the above-mentioned articles parameters and features:

- `replicationFactor` - the number of replicas for each metric.
- for every component of cluster (`vmstorage` / `vmselect` / `vminsert`):
  - `replicaCount` - the number of replicas for components of cluster.
  - `affinity` - the affinity (the pod's scheduling constraints) for components pods. See more details in [kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).
  - `topologySpreadConstraints` - controls how pods are spread across your cluster among failure-domains such as regions, zones, nodes, and other user-defined topology domains. See more details in [kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-topology-spread-constraints/).

In addition, operator:

- uses k8s services or vmauth for load balancing between `vminsert` and `vmselect` components,
- uses health checks for to determine the readiness of components for work after restart,
- allows to horizontally scale all cluster components just by changing `replicaCount` field.

Here is an example of a `VMCluster` resource with HA features:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1
kind: VMCluster
metadata:
  name: example-vmcluster-persistent
spec:
  replicationFactor: 2       
  vmstorage:
    replicaCount: 10
    storageDataPath: "/vm-data"
    affinity:
      podAntiAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: "app.kubernetes.io/name"
              operator: In
              values:
              - "vmstorage"
          topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
    storage:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 10Gi
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "2"
        memory: 2048Mi
  vmselect:
    replicaCount: 3
    cacheMountPath: "/select-cache"
    affinity:
      podAntiAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: "app.kubernetes.io/name"
              operator: In
              values:
              - "vmselect"
          topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
    storage:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 2Gi
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: "500Mi"
  vminsert:
    replicaCount: 4
    affinity:
      podAntiAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: "app.kubernetes.io/name"
              operator: In
              values:
              - "vminsert"
          topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: "500Mi"
```

## Version management

For `VMCluster` you can specify tag name from [releases](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases) and repository setting per cluster object:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1
kind: VMCluster
metadata:
  name: example-vmcluster
spec:
  vmstorage:
    replicaCount: 2
    image:
      repository: victoriametrics/vmstorage
      tag: v1.93.4-cluster
      pullPolicy: Always
  vmselect:
    replicaCount: 2
    image:
      repository: victoriametrics/vmselect
      tag: v1.93.4-cluster
      pullPolicy: Always
  vminsert:
    replicaCount: 2
    image:
      repository: victoriametrics/vminsert
      tag: v1.93.4-cluster
      pullPolicy: Always
```

Also, you can specify `imagePullSecrets` if you are pulling images from private repo, 
but `imagePullSecrets` is global setting for all `VMCluster` specification:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1
kind: VMCluster
metadata:
  name: example-vmcluster
spec:
  vmstorage:
    replicaCount: 2
    image:
      repository: victoriametrics/vmstorage
      tag: v1.93.4-cluster
      pullPolicy: Always
  vmselect:
    replicaCount: 2
    image:
      repository: victoriametrics/vmselect
      tag: v1.93.4-cluster
      pullPolicy: Always
  vminsert:
    replicaCount: 2
    image:
      repository: victoriametrics/vminsert
      tag: v1.93.4-cluster
      pullPolicy: Always
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: my-repo-secret
  # ...
```

## Enterprise features

VMCluster supports following features 
from [VictoriaMetrics Enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html#victoriametrics-enterprise):

- [Downsampling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#downsampling)
- [Multiple retentions / Retention filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#retention-filters)
- [Advanced per-tenant statistic](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/PerTenantStatistic.html)
- [mTLS for cluster components](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#mtls-protection)
- [Backup automation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager.html)

VMCluster doesn't support yet feature 
[Automatic discovery for vmstorage nodes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#automatic-vmstorage-discovery).

For using Enterprise version of [vmcluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html)
you need to change version of `VMCluster` to version with `-enterprise` suffix using [Version management](#version-management).

All the enterprise apps require `-eula` command-line flag to be passed to them.
This flag acknowledges that your usage fits one of the cases listed on [this page](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html#victoriametrics-enterprise).
So you can use [extraArgs](./README.md#extra-arguments) for passing this flag to `VMCluster`.

### Downsampling

After that you can pass [Downsampling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#downsampling)
flag to `VMCluster/vmselect` and `VMCluster/vmstorage` with [extraArgs](./README.md#extra-arguments) too.

Here are complete example for [Downsampling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#downsampling):

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1
kind: VMCluster
metadata:
  name: vmcluster-ent-example
spec:
  
  vmselect:
    # enabling enterprise features for vmselect
    image:
      # enterprise version of vmselect
      tag: v1.93.5-enterprise-cluster
    extraArgs:
      # should be true and means that you have the legal right to run a vmselect enterprise
      # that can either be a signed contract or an email with confirmation to run the service in a trial period
      # https://victoriametrics.com/legal/esa/
      eula: true
      
      # using enterprise features: Downsampling
      # more details about downsampling you can read on https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#downsampling
      downsampling.period: 30d:5m,180d:1h,1y:6h,2y:1d
      
  vmstorage:
    # enabling enterprise features for vmstorage
    image:
      # enterprise version of vmstorage
      tag: v1.93.5-enterprise-cluster
    extraArgs:
      # should be true and means that you have the legal right to run a vmstorage enterprise
      # that can either be a signed contract or an email with confirmation to run the service in a trial period
      # https://victoriametrics.com/legal/esa/
      eula: true

      # using enterprise features: Downsampling
      # more details about downsampling you can read on https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#downsampling
      downsampling.period: 30d:5m,180d:1h,1y:6h,2y:1d

  # ...other fields...
```

### Retention filters

You can pass [Retention filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#retention-filters)
flag to  `VMCluster/vmstorage` with [extraArgs](./README.md#extra-arguments).

Here are complete example for [Retention filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#retention-filters):

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1
kind: VMCluster
metadata:
  name: vmcluster-ent-example
spec:
  
  vmstorage:
    # enabling enterprise features for vmstorage
    image:
      # enterprise version of vmstorage
      tag: v1.93.5-enterprise-cluster
    extraArgs:
      # should be true and means that you have the legal right to run a vmstorage enterprise
      # that can either be a signed contract or an email with confirmation to run the service in a trial period
      # https://victoriametrics.com/legal/esa/
      eula: true

      # using enterprise features: Retention filters
      # more details about retention filters you can read on https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#retention-filters
      retentionFilter: '{vm_account_id="5",env="dev"}:5d,{vm_account_id="5",env="prod"}:5y'

  # ...other fields...
```

### Advanced per-tenant statistic

For using [Advanced per-tenant statistic](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/PerTenantStatistic.html)
you only need to [enable Enterprise version of vmcluster components](#enterprise-features) 
and operator will automatically create 
[Scrape objects](./vmagent.md#scraping) for cluster components.

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1
kind: VMCluster
metadata:
  name: vmcluster-ent-example
spec:
  
  vmselect:
    # enabling enterprise features for vmselect
    image:
      # enterprise version of vmselect
      tag: v1.93.5-enterprise-cluster
    extraArgs:
      # should be true and means that you have the legal right to run a vmselect enterprise
      # that can either be a signed contract or an email with confirmation to run the service in a trial period
      # https://victoriametrics.com/legal/esa/
      eula: true
      
  vminsert:
    # enabling enterprise features for vminsert
    image:
      # enterprise version of vminsert
      tag: v1.93.5-enterprise-cluster
    extraArgs:
      # should be true and means that you have the legal right to run a vminsert enterprise
      # that can either be a signed contract or an email with confirmation to run the service in a trial period
      # https://victoriametrics.com/legal/esa/
      eula: true
      
  vmstorage:
    # enabling enterprise features for vmstorage
    image:
      # enterprise version of vmstorage
      tag: v1.93.5-enterprise-cluster
    extraArgs:
      # should be true and means that you have the legal right to run a vmstorage enterprise
      # that can either be a signed contract or an email with confirmation to run the service in a trial period
      # https://victoriametrics.com/legal/esa/
      eula: true

  # ...other fields...
```

After that [VMAgent](./vmagent.md) will automatically 
scrape [Advanced per-tenant statistic](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/PerTenantStatistic.html) for cluster components.

### mTLS protection

You can pass [mTLS protection](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#mtls-protection)
flags to `VMCluster/vmstorage`, `VMCluster/vmselect` and `VMCluster/vminsert` with [extraArgs](./README.md#extra-arguments) and mount secret files 
with `extraVolumes` and `extraVolumeMounts` fields.

Here are complete example for [mTLS protection](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#mtls-protection)

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1
kind: VMCluster
metadata:
  name: vmcluster-ent-example
spec:
  
  vmselect:
    # enabling enterprise features for vmselect
    image:
      # enterprise version of vmselect
      tag: v1.93.5-enterprise-cluster
    extraArgs:
      # should be true and means that you have the legal right to run a vmselect enterprise
      # that can either be a signed contract or an email with confirmation to run the service in a trial period
      # https://victoriametrics.com/legal/esa/
      eula: true
      
      # using enterprise features: mTLS protection

### Backup automation

You can check [vmbackupmanager documentation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager.html) for backup automation.
It contains a description of the service and its features. This section covers vmbackumanager integration in vmoperator.

`VMCluster` has built-in backup configuration, it uses `vmbackupmanager` - proprietary tool for backups.
It supports incremental backups (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) with popular object storages (aws s3, google cloud storage).

Here is a complete example for backup configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1
kind: VMCluster
metadata:
  name: vmcluster-ent-example
spec:

  vmstorage:
    vmBackup:
      # should be true and means that you have the legal right to run a vmstorage enterprise
      # that can either be a signed contract or an email with confirmation to run the service in a trial period
      # https://victoriametrics.com/legal/esa/
      acceptEULA: true

      # using enterprise features: Backup automation
      # more details about backup automation you can read on https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager.html      
      destination: "s3://your_bucket/folder"
      credentialsSecret:
        name: remote-storage-keys
        key: credentials

  # ...other fields...

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: remote-storage-keys
type: Opaque
stringData:
  credentials: |-
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
    aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key
```

**NOTE**: for cluster version operator adds suffix for destination: `"s3://your_bucket/folder"`, it becomes `"s3://your_bucket/folder/$(POD_NAME)"`.
It's needed to make consistent backups for each storage node.

You can read more about backup configuration options and mechanics [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager.html)

Possible configuration options for backup crd can be found at [link](../api.md#vmbackup)

**Using VMBackupmanager for restoring backups** in Kubernetes environment is described [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager.html#how-to-restore-in-kubernetes).

Also see VMCLuster example spec [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator/blob/master/config/examples/vmcluster_with_backuper.yaml).
