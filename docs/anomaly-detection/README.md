# VictoriaMetrics Anomaly Detection

In the dynamic and complex world of system monitoring, VictoriaMetrics Anomaly Detection, being a part of our [Enterprise offering](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/), stands as a pivotal tool for achieving advanced observability. It empowers SREs and DevOps teams by automating the intricate task of identifying abnormal behavior in time-series data. It goes beyond traditional threshold-based alerting, utilizing machine learning techniques to not only detect anomalies but also minimize false positives, thus reducing alert fatigue. By providing simplified alerting mechanisms atop of [unified anomaly scores](/anomaly-detection/components/models.html#vmanomaly-output), it enables teams to spot and address potential issues faster, ensuring system reliability and operational efficiency.

## Practical Guides and Installation
Begin your VictoriaMetrics Anomaly Detection journey with ease using our guides and installation instructions:

- **Quickstart**: Check out how to get `vmanomaly` up and running [here](/anomaly-detection/QuickStart.html).
- **Overview**: Find out how `vmanomaly` service operates [here](/anomaly-detection/Overview.html)
- **Integration**: Integrate anomaly detection into your observability ecosystem. Get started [here](/anomaly-detection/guides/guide-vmanomaly-vmalert.html).

- **Installation Options**: Select the method that aligns with your technical requirements:
    - **Docker Installation**: Suitable for containerized environments. See [Docker guide](/anomaly-detection/Overview.html#run-vmanomaly-docker-container).
    - **Helm Chart Installation**: Appropriate for those using Kubernetes. See our [Helm charts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/victoria-metrics-anomaly).


> **Note**: starting from [v1.5.0](./CHANGELOG.md#v150) `vmanomaly` requires a [license key](/anomaly-detection/Overview.html#licensing) to run. You can obtain a trial license key [**here**](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/trial/).
