In the dynamic and complex world of system monitoring, [VictoriaMetrics Anomaly Detection](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/anomaly-detection/) (or shortly, `vmanomaly`), being a part of our [Enterprise offering](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/), stands as a pivotal tool for achieving advanced observability. It empowers SREs and DevOps teams by automating the identification of abnormal behavior in time-series data. It goes beyond traditional threshold-based alerting, utilizing machine learning techniques to not only detect anomalies but also minimize false positives, thus reducing alert fatigue. By providing simplified alerting mechanisms atop of [unified anomaly scores](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#vmanomaly-output), it enables teams to spot and address potential issues faster, ensuring system reliability and operational efficiency.

## Practical Guides and Installation

Get started with VictoriaMetrics Anomaly Detection efficiently by following our guides and installation options:

- **Quickstart**: Learn how to quickly set up `vmanomaly` by following the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/quickstart/).
- **Overview**: Understand the architecture and operation of the `vmanomaly` service [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/overview/).
- **Integration**: Integrate anomaly detection into your existing observability stack. Find detailed steps [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/guides/guide-vmanomaly-vmalert/).
- **Anomaly Detection Presets**: Enable anomaly detection on predefined sets of metrics that require frequent static threshold changes for alerting. Learn more [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/presets/).

- **Installation Options**: Choose the installation method that best fits your infrastructure:
    - **Docker Installation**: Ideal for containerized environments. Follow the [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/overview/#run-vmanomaly-docker-container).
    - **Helm Chart Installation**: Recommended for Kubernetes deployments. See our [Helm charts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/victoria-metrics-anomaly).

- **Self-Monitoring**: Ensure `vmanomaly` is functioning optimally with built-in self-monitoring capabilities. Use the provided Grafana dashboards and alerting rules to track service health and operational metrics. Find the complete docs [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/self-monitoring/).

> **Note**: starting from [v1.5.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/changelog/#v150) `vmanomaly` requires a [license key](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/overview/#licensing) to run. You can obtain a trial license key [**here**](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/trial/).
