# Models

This section describes `Model` component of VictoriaMetrics Anomaly Detection (or simply [`vmanomaly`](/vmanomaly.html)) and the guide of how to define respective section of a config to launch the service.


Please find a guide of how to use [built-in models](/anomaly-detection/components/models/models.html) for anomaly detection, as well as how to define and use your own [custom model](/anomaly-detection/components/models/custom_model.html).
