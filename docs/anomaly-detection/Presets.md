> Please check the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/quickstart/) to install and run `vmanomaly`

> Presets are available starting from [v1.13.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/changelog/#v1130)


**Preset** mode allows for simpler configuration and anomaly detection with `vmanomaly` on widely-recognized metrics, such as those generated by [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter), which are typically challenging to monitor using static threshold-based alerting rules.

This approach represents a paradigm shift from traditional [static threshold-based alerting rules](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/victoriametrics-anomaly-detection-handbook-chapter-1/#rule-based-alerting), focused on *raw metric values*, to *static* rules based on [`anomaly_scores`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/faq/#what-is-anomaly-score). These scores offer a consistent, default threshold that remains stable over time, being adjusted for trends, seasonality, data scale, thus, reducing the engineering effort required for maintenance. Anomaly scores are produced by [machine learning models](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/), which are regularly retrained on varying time frames, ensuring alerts remain current and responsive to evolving data patterns.

Additionally, **preset mode** minimizes user input needed to run the service. You can configure `vmanomaly` by specifying only the preset name and data sources in the [`reader`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/reader/) and [`writer`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/writer/) sections of the configuration file. All other parameters are already preconfigured.


Available presets:
- [Node-Exporter](#node-exporter)

To enable preset mode, `preset` arg should be set to particular preset name:

```yaml
preset: "chosen_preset_name"  # i.e. "node-exporter"
```

Also, additional minimal set of arguments may be required from user to run the preset. See corresponding preset sections below for the details.

Run a service using config file with one of the [available options](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/quickstart/#how-to-install-and-run-vmanomaly).

After you run `vmanomaly` with `preset` arg specified, available assets can be viewed, copied and downloaded at `http://localhost:8490/presets/` endpoint.

## Node-Exporter

The Node-Exporter preset simplifies the monitoring and anomaly detection of key system metrics collected by [`node_exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter). This preset reduces the need for manual configuration and detects anomalies in metrics such as CPU usage, network errors, and disk latency, ensuring timely identification of potential issues. Below are detailed instructions on enabling and using the Node-Exporter preset, along with a list of included assets like alerting rules and Grafana dashboard.

> **Note: Node-Exporter preset assets can be also found [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker/vmanomaly/vmanomaly-node-exporter-preset/)**

For enabling Node-Exporter in config file set the `preset` arg accordingly. Also, include at least `datasource_url`-s (and `tenant_id` if using cluster version of VictoriaMetrics) in reader and writer sections, like that:

```yaml
preset: "node-exporter"
reader:
  datasource_url: "http://victoriametrics:8428/" # source victoriametrics/prometheus
  # tenant_id: '0:0'  # specify for cluster version
writer:
  datasource_url: "http://victoriametrics:8428/" # destination victoriametrics/prometheus
  # tenant_id: '0:0'  # specify for cluster version
```

Run a service using such config file with one of the [available options](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/quickstart/#how-to-install-and-run-vmanomaly).

### Generated anomaly scores
Machine learning models will be fit for each timeseries, returned by underlying [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/) queries.
Anomaly score metric labels will also contain [model classes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/) and [schedulers](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/scheduler/) for labelset uniqueness.

Here's an example of produced metrics:

### Alerts
> For optimal alerting experience, we include [Awesome alerts](https://github.com/samber/awesome-prometheus-alerts) to cover indicators not addressed by the preset, as static thresholds can effectively complement our machine learning approach.

> Provided `vmanomaly` alerts are set to fire only if *all anomaly detection models* vote that the datapoint is anomalous.

You can find corresponding alerting rules here:
- `vmanomaly` [Anomaly Detection alerts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker/vmanomaly/vmanomaly-node-exporter-preset/vmanomaly_alerts.yml): `http://localhost:8490/presets/vmanomaly_alerts.yml`
- [Modified Awesome Alerts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker/vmanomaly/vmanomaly-node-exporter-preset/awesome_alerts.yml): `http://localhost:8490/presets/awesome_alerts.yml`

#### Awesome Alerts replaced by Machine Learning alerts

## Example

Here's how attached [Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker/vmanomaly/vmanomaly-node-exporter-preset/dashboard.json) can be used to drill down anomalies:

On the (global) graph **'Percentage of Anomalies'**, you can see a spike 8.75% of anomalies at the timestamp '2024-06-03 10:35:00'. The (global) graph **'Anomalies per Indicator'** shows the indicators that were anomalous at the corresponding time.

![global](presets_global_percentage.webp)


At this timestamp on the **'Number of Anomalous Indicators by Node'** graph we can identify the node that had the most anomalies: `10.142.0.27`

![by_node](presets_anomalies_by_node.webp)


Now you can select anomalous node to drill down further (local):

![anomalous_node_selection](presets_anomalous_node_selection.webp)


For this node from the timestamp `2024-06-03 10:35:00` CPU time spent handling software interrupts started to grow.
(`cpu_seconds_total{mode="softirq"}`)

![irq](presets_cpu_seconds_softirq.webp)


At the same time `cpu_seconds_total` for `steal` mode started to grow as well.
