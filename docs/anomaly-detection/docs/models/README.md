# Models

This section is dedicated to `Model` section of a config to launch VictoriaMetrics Anomaly Detection (or simply [`vmanomaly`](/vmanomaly.html)) service


Please find a guide of how to use [built-in models](/anomaly-detection/docs/models/models.html) for anomaly detection, as well as how to define [own, custom models](/anomaly-detection/docs/models/custom_model.html).
