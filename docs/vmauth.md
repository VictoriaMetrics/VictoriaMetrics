# vmauth

`vmauth` is a simple auth proxy, router and [load balancer](#load-balancing) for [VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
It reads auth credentials from `Authorization` http header ([Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication),
`Bearer token` and [InfluxDB authorization](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1897) is supported),
matches them against configs pointed by [-auth.config](#auth-config) command-line flag and proxies incoming HTTP requests to the configured per-user `url_prefix` on successful match.
The `-auth.config` can point to either local file or to http url.

## Quick start

Just download `vmutils-*` archive from [releases page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest), unpack it
and pass the following flag to `vmauth` binary in order to start authorizing and proxying requests:

```console
/path/to/vmauth -auth.config=/path/to/auth/config.yml
```

The `-auth.config` command-line flag must point to valid [config](#auth-config). See [use cases](#use-cases) with typical `-auth.config` examples.

`vmauth` accepts HTTP requests on port `8427` and proxies them according to the provided [-auth.config](#auth-config).
The port can be modified via `-httpListenAddr` command-line flag.

The auth config can be reloaded via the following ways:

- By passing `SIGHUP` signal to `vmauth`.
- By querying `/-/reload` http endpoint. This endpoint can be protected with `-reloadAuthKey` command-line flag. See [security docs](#security) for more details.
- By specifying `-configCheckInterval` command-line flag to the interval between config re-reads. For example, `-configCheckInterval=5s` will re-read the config
  and apply new changes every 5 seconds.

Docker images for `vmauth` are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/vmauth/tags).
See how `vmauth` used in [docker-compose env](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/deployment/docker/README.md#victoriametrics-cluster).

Pass `-help` to `vmauth` in order to see all the supported command-line flags with their descriptions.

### Simple HTTP proxy

The following [`-auth.config`](#auth-config) instructs `vmauth` to proxy all the incoming requests to the given backend.
For example, requests to `http://vmauth:8427/foo/bar` are proxied to `http://backend/foo/bar`:

```yml
unauthorized_user:
  url_prefix: "http://backend/"
```

`vmauth` can balance load among multiple backends - see [these docs](#load-balancing) for details.

### Generic HTTP proxy for different backends

`vmauth` can proxy requests to different backends depending on the requested host and/or path.
For example, the following [`-auth.config`](#auth-config) instructs `vmauth` to make the following:

- Requests starting with `/app1/` are proxied to `http://app1-backend/`, while the `/app1/` path prefix is dropped according to [`drop_src_path_prefix_parts`](#dropping-request-path-prefix).
  For example, the request to `http://vmauth:8427/app1/foo/bar?baz=qwe` is proxied to `http://app1-backend/foo/bar?baz=qwe`.
- Requests starting with `/app2/` are proxied to `http://app2-backend/`, while the `/app2/` path prefix is dropped according to [`drop_src_path_prefix_parts`](#dropping-request-path-prefix).
  For example, the request to `http://vmauth:8427/app2/index.html` is proxied to `http://app2-backend/index.html`.
- Other requests are proxied to `http://some-backend/404-page.html`, while the requested path is passed via `request_path` query arg.
  For example, the request to `http://vmauth:8427/foo/bar?baz=qwe` is proxied to `http://some-backend/404-page.html?request_path=%2Ffoo%2Fbar%3Fbaz%3Dqwe`.

```yml
unauthorized_user:
  url_map:
  - src_paths:
    - "/app1/.*"
    drop_src_path_prefix_parts: 1
    url_prefix: "http://app1-backend/"
  - src_paths:
    - "/app2/.*"
    drop_src_path_prefix_parts: 1
    url_prefix: "http://app2-backend/"
  default_url: http://some-backend/404-page.html
```

The following config routes requests to host `app1.my-host.com` to `http://app1-backend`, while routing requests to `app2.my-host.com` to `http://app2-backend`:

```yml
unauthorized_user:
  url_map:
  - src_hosts:
    - "app1\\.my-host\\.com"
    url_prefix: "http://app1-backend/"
  - src_paths:
    - "app2\\.my-host\\.com"
    url_prefix: "http://app2-backend/"
```

`src_paths` and `src_hosts` accept a list of [regular expressions](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax). The incoming request is routed to the given `url_prefix`
if the whole request path matches at least one `src_paths` entry. The incoming request is routed to the given `url_prefix` if the whole request host matches at least one `src_hosts` entry.
If both `src_paths` and `src_hosts` lists are specified, then the request is routed to the given `url_prefix` when both request path and request host match at least one entry
in the corresponding lists.

### Generic HTTP load balancer

`vmauth` can balance load among multiple HTTP backends in least-loaded round-robin mode.
For example, the following [`-auth.config`](#auth-config) instructs `vmauth` to spread load load among multiple application instances:

```yml
unauthorized_user:
  url_prefix:
  - "http://app-instance-1/"
  - "http://app-instance-2/"
  - "http://app-instance-3/"
```

See [load balancing docs](#load-balancing) for more details.

### Load balancer for vmagent

If [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html) is used for processing [data push requests](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#how-to-push-data-to-vmagent),
then it is possible to scale the performance of data processing at `vmagent` by spreading load among multiple identically configured `vmagent` instances.
This can be done with the following [config](#auth-config) for `vmagent`:

```yml
unauthorized_user:
  url_map:
  - src_paths:
    - "/prometheus/api/v1/write"
    - "/influx/write"
    - "/api/v1/import"
    - "/api/v1/import/.+"
    url_prefix:
    - "http://vmagent-1:8429/"
    - "http://vmagent-2:8429/"
    - "http://vmagent-3:8429/"
```

See [load balancing docs](#load-balancing) for more details.

### Load balancer for VictoriaMetrics cluster

[VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html) accepts incoming data via `vminsert` nodes
and processes incoming requests via `vmselect` nodes according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#architecture-overview).
`vmauth` can be used for balancing both `insert` and `select` requests among `vminsert` and `vmselect` nodes, when the following [`-auth.config`](#auth-config) is used:

```yml
unauthorized_user:
  url_map:
  - src_paths:
    - "/insert/.+"
    url_prefix:
    - "http://vminsert-1:8480/"
    - "http://vminsert-2:8480/"
    - "http://vminsert-3:8480/"
  - src_paths:
    - "/select/.+"
    url_prefix:
    - "http://vmselect-1:8481/"
    - "http://vmselect-2:8481/"
```

See [load balancing docs](#load-balancing) for more details.

### High availability

`vmauth` automatically switches from temporarily unavailable backend to other hot standby backends listed in `url_prefix`
if it runs with `-loadBalancingPolicy=first_available` command-line flag. The load balancing policy can be overridden at `user` and `url_map` sections
of [`-auth.config`](#auth-config) via `load_balancing_policy` option. For example, the following config instructs `vmauth` to proxy requests to `http://victoria-metrics-main:8428/` backend.
If this backend becomes unavailable, then `vmauth` starts proxying requests to `http://victoria-metrics-standby1:8428/`.
If this backend becomes also unavailable, then requests are proxied to the last specified backend - `http://victoria-metrics-standby2:8428/`:

```yml
unauthorized_user:
  url_prefix:
  - "http://victoria-metrics-main:8428/"
  - "http://victoria-metrics-standby1:8428/"
  - "http://victoria-metrics-standby2:8428/"
  load_balancing_policy: first_available
```

See [load-balancing docs](#load-balancing) for more details.

### TLS termination proxy

`vmauth` can terminate HTTPS requests to backend services when it runs with the following command-line flags:

```
/path/to/vmauth -tls -tlsKeyFile=/path/to/tls_key_file -tlsCertFile=/path/to/tls_cert_file -httpListenAddr=0.0.0.0:443
```

* `-httpListenAddr` sets the address to listen for incoming HTTPS requests
* `-tls` enables accepting TLS connections at `-httpListenAddr`
* `-tlsKeyFile` sets the path to TLS certificate key file
* `-tlsCertFile` sets the path to TLS certificate file

### Basic Auth proxy

`vmauth` can authorize access to backends depending on the provided [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) request headers.
For example, the following [config](#auth-config) proxies requests to [single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/)
if they contain Basic Auth header with the given `username` and `password`:

```yml
users:
- username: foo
  password: bar
  url_prefix: "http://victoria-metrics:8428/"
```

See also [security docs](#security).

### Bearer Token auth proxy

`vmauth` can authorize access to backends depending on the provided `Bearer Token` request headers.
For example, the following [config](#auth-config) proxies requests to [single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/)
if they contain the given `bearer_token`:

```yml
users:
- bearer_token: ABCDEF
  url_prefix: "http://victoria-metrics:8428/"
```

See also [security docs](#security).

### Per-tenant authorization

The following [`-auth.config`](#auth-config) instructs proxying `insert` and `select` requests from the [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
user `tenant1` to the [tenant](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#multitenancy) `1`,
while requests from the user `tenant2` are sent to tenant `2`:

```yml
users:
- username: tenant1
  password: "***"
  url_map:
  - src_paths:
    - "/api/v1/write"
    url_prefix: "http://vminsert-backend:8480/insert/1/prometheus/"
  - src_paths:
    - "/api/v1/query"
    - "/api/v1/query_range"
    - "/api/v1/series"
    - "/api/v1/labels"
    - "/api/v1/label/.+/values"
    url_prefix: "http://vmselect-backend:8481/select/1/prometheus/"
- username: tenant2
  password: "***"
  url_map:
  - src_paths:
    - "/api/v1/write"
    url_prefix: "http://vminsert-backend:8480/insert/2/prometheus/"
  - src_paths:
    - "/api/v1/query"
    - "/api/v1/query_range"
    - "/api/v1/series"
    - "/api/v1/labels"
    - "/api/v1/label/.+/values"
    url_prefix: "http://vmselect-backend:8481/select/2/prometheus/"
```

### Enforcing query args

`vmauth` can be configured for adding some mandatory query args before proxying requests to backends.
For example, the following [config](#auth-config) adds [`extra_label`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#prometheus-querying-api-enhancements)
to all the requests, which are proxied to [single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/):

```yml
unauthorized_user:
  url_prefix: "http://victoria-metrics:8428/?extra_label=foo=bar"
```

## Dropping request path prefix

By default `vmauth` doesn't drop the path prefix from the original request when proxying the request to the matching backend.
Sometimes it is needed to drop path prefix before proxying the request to the backend. This can be done by specifying the number of `/`-delimited
prefix parts to drop from the request path via `drop_src_path_prefix_parts` option at `url_map` level or at `user` level.

For example, if you need to serve requests to [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html) at `/vmalert/` path prefix,
while serving requests to [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html) at `/vmagent/` path prefix for a particular user,
then the following [-auth.config](#auth-config) can be used:

```yml
users:
- username: foo
  url_map:

    # proxy all the requests, which start with `/vmagent/`, to vmagent backend
  - src_paths:
    - "/vmagent/.+"

    # drop /vmagent/ path prefix from the original request before proxying it to url_prefix.
    drop_src_path_prefix_parts: 1
    url_prefix: "http://vmagent-backend:8429/"

    # proxy all the requests, which start with `/vmalert`, to vmalert backend
  - src_paths:
    - "/vmalert/.+"

    # drop /vmalert/ path prefix from the original request before proxying it to url_prefix.
    drop_src_path_prefix_parts: 1
    url_prefix: "http://vmalert-backend:8880/"
```

## Load balancing

Each `url_prefix` in the [-auth.config](#auth-config) can be specified in the following forms:

- A single url. For example:

  ```yml
  unauthorized_user:
    url_prefix: 'http://vminsert:8480/insert/0/prometheus/`
  ```

  In this case `vmauth` proxies requests to the specified url.

- A list of urls. For example:

  ```yml
  unauthorized_user:
    url_prefix:
    - 'http://vminsert-1:8480/insert/0/prometheus/'
    - 'http://vminsert-2:8480/insert/0/prometheus/'
    - 'http://vminsert-3:8480/insert/0/prometheus/'
  ```

  In this case `vmauth` spreads requests among the specified urls using least-loaded round-robin policy.
  This guarantees that incoming load is shared uniformly among the specified backends.

  `vmauth` automatically detects temporarily unavailable backends and spreads incoming queries among the remaining available backends.
  This allows restarting the backends and peforming mantenance tasks on the backends without the need to remove them from the `url_prefix` list.

  By default `vmauth` returns backend responses with all the http status codes to the client. It is possible to configure automatic retry of requests
  at other backends if the backend responds with status code specified in the `-retryStatusCodes` command-line flag.
  It is possible to customize the list of http response status codes to retry via `retry_status_codes` list at `user` and `url_map` level of [`-auth.config`](#auth-config).
  For example, the following config re-tries requests on other backends if the current backend returns response with `500` or `502` HTTP status code:

  ```yml
  unauthorized_user:
    url_prefix:
    - http://vmselect1:8481/
    - http://vmselect2:8481/
    - http://vmselect3:8481/
    retry_status_codes: [500, 502]
  ```

  By default `vmauth` uses `least_loaded` policy for spreading incoming requests among available backends.
  The policy can be changed to `first_available` via `-loadBalancingPolicy` command-line flag. In this case `vmauth`
  sends all the requests to the first specified backend while it is available. `vmauth` starts sending requests to the next
  specified backend when the first backend is temporarily unavailable.
  It is possible to customize the load balancing policy at the `user` and `url_map` level.
  For example, the following config specifies `first_available` load balancing policy for unauthorized requests:

  ```yml
  unauthorized_user:
    url_prefix:
    - http://victoria-metrics-main:8428/
    - http://victoria-metrics-standby:8428/
    load_balancing_policy: first_available
  ```

Load balancing feature can be used in the following cases:

- Balancing the load among multiple `vmselect` and/or `vminsert` nodes in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html).
  The following [`-auth.config`](#auth-config) can be used for spreading incoming requests among 3 vmselect nodes and re-trying failed requests
  or requests with 500 and 502 response status codes:

  ```yml
  unauthorized_user:
    url_prefix:
    - http://vmselect1:8481/
    - http://vmselect2:8481/
    - http://vmselect3:8481/
    retry_status_codes: [500, 502]
  ```

- Sending select queries to the closest availability zone (AZ), while falling back to other AZs with identical data if the closest AZ is unavaialable.
  For example, the following [`-auth.config`](#auth-config) sends select queries to `https://vmselect-az1/` and uses the `https://vmselect-az2/` as a fallback
  when `https://vmselect-az1/` is temporarily unavailable or cannot return full responses.
  See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#cluster-availability) for details about `deny_partial_response` query arg,
  which is added to requests before they are proxied to backends.

  ```yml
  unauthorized_user:
    url_prefix:
    - https://vmselect-az1/?deny_partial_response=1
    - https://vmselect-az2/?deny_partial_response=1
    retry_status_codes: [500, 502, 503]
    load_balancing_policy: first_available
  ```

Load balancig can be configured independently per each `user` entry and per each `url_map` entry. See [auth config docs](#auth-config) for more details.

## Modifying HTTP headers

`vmauth` supports the ability to set and remove HTTP request headers before sending the requests to backends.
This is done via `headers` option. For example, the following [`-auth.config`](#auth-config) adds `TenantID: foobar` header
to requests proxied to `http://backend:1234/`. It also overrides `X-Forwarded-For` request header with an empty value. This effectively
removes the `X-Forwarded-For` header from requests proxied to `http://backend:1234/`:

```yml
unauthorized_user:
  url_prefix: "http://backend:1234/"
  headers:
  - "TenantID: foobar"
  - "X-Forwarded-For:"
```

`vmauth` also supports the ability to set and remove HTTP response headers before returning the response from the backend to client.
This is done via `response_headers` option. For example, the following [`-auth.config`](#auth-config) adds `Foo: bar` response header
and removes `Server` response header before returning the response to client:

```yml
unauthorized_user:
  url_prefix: "http://backend:1234/"
  response_headers:
  - "Foo: bar"
  - "Server:"
```

## Concurrency limiting

`vmauth` limits the number of concurrent requests it can proxy according to the following command-line flags:

- `-maxConcurrentRequests` limits the global number of concurrent requests `vmauth` can serve across all the configured users.
- `-maxConcurrentPerUserRequests` limits the number of concurrent requests `vmauth` can serve per each configured user.

It is also possible to set individual limits on the number of concurrent requests per each user
with the `max_concurrent_requests` option - see [auth config example](#auth-config).

`vmauth` responds with `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP error when the number of concurrent requests exceeds the configured limits.

The following [metrics](#monitoring) related to concurrency limits are exposed by `vmauth`:

- `vmauth_concurrent_requests_capacity` - the global limit on the number of concurrent requests `vmauth` can serve.
  It is set via `-maxConcurrentRequests` command-line flag.
- `vmauth_concurrent_requests_current` - the current number of concurrent requests `vmauth` processes.
- `vmauth_concurrent_requests_limit_reached_total` - the number of requests rejected with `429 Too Many Requests` error
  because of the global concurrency limit has been reached.
- `vmauth_user_concurrent_requests_capacity{username="..."}` - the limit on the number of concurrent requests for the given `username`.
- `vmauth_user_concurrent_requests_current{username="..."}` - the current number of concurrent requests for the given `username`.
- `vmauth_user_concurrent_requests_limit_reached_total{username="foo"}` - the number of requests rejected with `429 Too Many Requests` error
  because of the concurrency limit has been reached for the given `username`.
- `vmauth_unauthorized_user_concurrent_requests_capacity` - the limit on the number of concurrent requests for unauthorized users (if `unauthorized_user` section is used).
- `vmauth_unauthorized_user_concurrent_requests_current` - the current number of concurrent requests for unauthorized users (if `unauthorized_user` section is used).
- `vmauth_unauthorized_user_concurrent_requests_limit_reached_total` - the number of requests rejected with `429 Too Many Requests` error
  because of the concurrency limit has been reached for unauthorized users (if `unauthorized_user` section is used).

## Backend TLS setup

By default `vmauth` uses system settings when performing requests to HTTPS backends specified via `url_prefix` option
in the [`-auth.config`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html#auth-config). These settings can be overridden with the following command-line flags:

- `-backend.tlsInsecureSkipVerify` allows skipping TLS verification when connecting to HTTPS backends.
  This global setting can be overridden at per-user level inside [`-auth.config`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html#auth-config)
  via `tls_insecure_skip_verify` option. For example:

  ```yml
  - username: "foo"
    url_prefix: "https://localhost"
    tls_insecure_skip_verify: true
  ```

- `-backend.tlsCAFile` allows specifying the path to TLS Root CA, which will be used for TLS verification when connecting to HTTPS backends.
  The `-backend.tlsCAFile` may point either to local file or to `http` / `https` url.
  This global setting can be overridden at per-user level inside [`-auth.config`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html#auth-config)
  via `tls_ca_file` option. For example:

  ```yml
  - username: "foo"
    url_prefix: "https://localhost"
    tls_ca_file: "/path/to/tls/root/ca"
  ```

## IP filters

[Enterprise version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html) of `vmauth` can be configured to allow / deny incoming requests via global and per-user IP filters.

For example, the following config allows requests to `vmauth` from `10.0.0.0/24` network and from `1.2.3.4` IP address, while denying requests from `10.0.0.42` IP address:

```yml
users:
# User configs here

ip_filters:
  allow_list:
  - 10.0.0.0/24
  - 1.2.3.4
  deny_list: [10.0.0.42]
```

The following config allows requests for the user 'foobar' only from the IP `127.0.0.1`:

```yml
users:
- username: "foobar"
  password: "***"
  url_prefix: "http://localhost:8428"
  ip_filters:
    allow_list: [127.0.0.1]
```

See config example of using IP filters [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmauth/example_config_ent.yml).

## Auth config

`-auth.config` is represented in the following simple `yml` format:

```yml
# Arbitrary number of usernames may be put here.
# It is possible to set multiple identical usernames with different passwords.
# Such usernames can be differentiated by `name` option.

users:
  # Requests with the 'Authorization: Bearer XXXX' and 'Authorization: Token XXXX'
  # header are proxied to http://localhost:8428 .
  # For example, http://vmauth:8427/api/v1/query is proxied to http://localhost:8428/api/v1/query
  # Requests with the Basic Auth username=XXXX are proxied to http://localhost:8428 as well.
- bearer_token: "XXXX"
  url_prefix: "http://localhost:8428"

  # Requests with the 'Authorization: Bearer YYY' header are proxied to http://localhost:8428 ,
  # The `X-Scope-OrgID: foobar` http header is added to every proxied request.
  # The `X-Server-Hostname` http header is removed from the proxied response.
  # For example, http://vmauth:8427/api/v1/query is proxied to http://localhost:8428/api/v1/query
- bearer_token: "YYY"
  url_prefix: "http://localhost:8428"
  # extra headers to add to the request or remove from the request (if header value is empty)
  headers:
    - "X-Scope-OrgID: foobar"
  # extra headers to add to the response or remove from the response (if header value is empty)
  response_headers:
    - "X-Server-Hostname:" # empty value means the header will be removed from the response

  # All the requests to http://vmauth:8427 with the given Basic Auth (username:password)
  # are proxied to http://localhost:8428 .
  # For example, http://vmauth:8427/api/v1/query is proxied to http://localhost:8428/api/v1/query
  #
  # The given user can send maximum 10 concurrent requests according to the provided max_concurrent_requests.
  # Excess concurrent requests are rejected with 429 HTTP status code.
  # See also -maxConcurrentPerUserRequests and -maxConcurrentRequests command-line flags.
- username: "local-single-node"
  password: "***"
  url_prefix: "http://localhost:8428"
  max_concurrent_requests: 10

  # All the requests to http://vmauth:8427 with the given Basic Auth (username:password)

The config may contain `%{ENV_VAR}` placeholders, which are substituted by the corresponding `ENV_VAR` environment variable values.
This may be useful for passing secrets to the config.

Please note, vmauth doesn't follow redirects. If destination redirects request to a new location, make sure this 
location is supported in vmauth `url_map` config.

## Security

It is expected that all the backend services protected by `vmauth` are located in an isolated private network, so they can be accessed by external users only via `vmauth`.

Do not transfer Basic Auth headers in plaintext over untrusted networks. Enable https at `-httpListenAddr`. This can be done by passing the following `-tls*` command-line flags to `vmauth`:

```console
  -tls
     Whether to enable TLS for incoming HTTP requests at -httpListenAddr (aka https). -tlsCertFile and -tlsKeyFile must be set if -tls is set
  -tlsCertFile string
     Path to file with TLS certificate. Used only if -tls is set. Prefer ECDSA certs instead of RSA certs, since RSA certs are slow
  -tlsKeyFile string
     Path to file with TLS key. Used only if -tls is set
```

Alternatively, [https termination proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy) may be put in front of `vmauth`.

It is recommended protecting the following endpoints with authKeys:
* `/-/reload` with `-reloadAuthKey` command-line flag, so external users couldn't trigger config reload.
* `/flags` with `-flagsAuthKey` command-line flag, so unauthorized users couldn't get application command-line flags.
* `/metrics` with `-metricsAuthKey` command-line flag, so unauthorized users couldn't get access to [vmauth metrics](#monitoring).
* `/debug/pprof` with `-pprofAuthKey` command-line flag, so unauthorized users couldn't get access to [profiling information](#profiling).

`vmauth` also supports the ability to restrict access by IP - see [these docs](#ip-filters). See also [concurrency limiting docs](#concurrency-limiting).

## Monitoring

`vmauth` exports various metrics in Prometheus exposition format at `http://vmauth-host:8427/metrics` page. It is recommended setting up regular scraping of this page
either via [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html) or via Prometheus, so the exported metrics could be analyzed later.

`vmauth` exports `vmauth_user_requests_total` [counter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#counter) metric 
and `vmauth_user_request_duration_seconds_*` [summary](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#summary) metric 
with `username` label. The `username` label value equals to `username` field value set in the `-auth.config` file.
It is possible to override or hide the value in the label by specifying `name` field. 
For example, the following config will result in `vmauth_user_requests_total{username="foobar"}` 
instead of `vmauth_user_requests_total{username="secret_user"}`:

```yml
users:
- username: "secret_user"
  name: "foobar"
  # other config options here
```

For unauthorized users `vmauth` exports `vmauth_unauthorized_user_requests_total` 
[counter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#counter) metric and 
`vmauth_unauthorized_user_request_duration_seconds_*` [summary](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#summary)
metric without label (if `unauthorized_user` section of config is used).

## How to build from sources

It is recommended using [binary releases](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest) - `vmauth` is located in `vmutils-*` archives there.

### Development build

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install). The minimum supported version is Go 1.20.
1. Run `make vmauth` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds `vmauth` binary and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Production build

1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
1. Run `make vmauth-prod` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds `vmauth-prod` binary and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Building docker images

Run `make package-vmauth`. It builds `victoriametrics/vmauth:<PKG_TAG>` docker image locally.
`<PKG_TAG>` is auto-generated image tag, which depends on source code in the repository.
The `<PKG_TAG>` may be manually set via `PKG_TAG=foobar make package-vmauth`.

The base docker image is [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) but it is possible to use any other base image
by setting it via `<ROOT_IMAGE>` environment variable. For example, the following command builds the image on top of [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) image:

```console
ROOT_IMAGE=scratch make package-vmauth
```

## Profiling

`vmauth` provides handlers for collecting the following [Go profiles](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs):

* Memory profile. It can be collected with the following command (replace `0.0.0.0` with hostname if needed):

<div class="with-copy" markdown="1">

```console
curl http://0.0.0.0:8427/debug/pprof/heap > mem.pprof
```

</div>

* CPU profile. It can be collected with the following command (replace `0.0.0.0` with hostname if needed):

<div class="with-copy" markdown="1">

```console
curl http://0.0.0.0:8427/debug/pprof/profile > cpu.pprof
```

</div>

The command for collecting CPU profile waits for 30 seconds before returning.

The collected profiles may be analyzed with [go tool pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof).
It is safe sharing the collected profiles from security point of view, since they do not contain sensitive information.

## Advanced usage

Pass `-help` command-line arg to `vmauth` in order to see all the configuration options:

```console
./vmauth -help

vmauth authenticates and authorizes incoming requests and proxies them to VictoriaMetrics.

See the docs at https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html .
