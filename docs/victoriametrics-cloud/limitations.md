# VictoriaMetrics Cloud Tiers Limitations

The calculation of tiers limitations is based on testing on monitoring environments with typical characteristics on our research. This means that these parameters are not guaranteed and may differ for your specific load type.

Tiers characteristics in VictoriaMetrics Cloud are calculated based on the following limitations:

| Parameter                                                 | Limit                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data ingestion rate (datapoints/s)**                    | *according to the tier parameters* | Ingestion rate indicates how many [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#time-series) are pushed into the database per second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Active time series count**                              | *according to the tier parameters* | Time series that receive at least one datapoint in the past hour are considered as [Active time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/faq/#what-is-an-active-time-series). High value may result in ingestion slowdown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Read rate (datapoints/s)**                              | *according to the tier parameters* | Read rate is the cumulative number of datapoints retrieved from the database per second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **New series over 24 hours**                              | `<= Active time series count`      | Total number of new series created over last 24 hours. This is an indicator characterizing [Churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/faq/#what-is-high-churn-rate). High churn rate tightly connected with database performance and may result in unexpected failures or slow queries. It is recommended to always keep an eye on this indicator to avoid unexpected [cardinality](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#cardinality) "explosions". The higher churn rate is, the more resources required to handle it.  |
| **Datapoint size (bytes per point)**                      | `<= 0.8b`                          | Average disk usage per datapoint. If you ingest high [cardinality](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#cardinality) data, this increases the data point size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Concurrent requests count per Access token**            | `<= 600`                           | We recommend create separate access tokens for different clients, tenants, environments. This parameter can be changed via [support](support@victoriametrics.com)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Max label value length (`maxLabelValueLen`)**           | `<= 1kb`                           | The maximum length of label values in the accepted time series. Longer label values are truncated. Default value for this parameter in VMCloud - `4kb`, but it can be changed via [support](support@victoriametrics.com). It is very important to keep under control the number of unique label values, since every unique label value leads to a new time series. Try to avoid using volatile label values such as session ID or query ID in order to avoid excessive resource usage and database slowdown.                         |
| **Max labels per time series (`maxLabelsPerTimeseries`)** | `<= 30`                            | The maximum number of labels accepted per time series. Superfluous labels are dropped. Default value for this parameter in VMCloud - `30`, but you can [change it in settings](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics-cloud/quickstart/#modifying-an-existing-deployment). A large number of labels can lead to increased [cardinality](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#cardinality). Try to collect only the labels you really need.                                                                        |
| **Disk usage**                                            | `<= 80%`                           | The amount of disk space used by the database. VictoriaMetrics requires free disk space for merging data files to bigger ones. It may slow down when there is no enough free space left because increases overhead during data querying, since VictoriaMetrics needs to read data from bigger number of parts per each request. So make sure storage has at least 20% of free space.                                                                                                                                                 |
