## Deployments

VictoriaMetrics Cloud is a DBaaS (Database as a Service) product for VictoriaMetrics.
This means that you need to [create a deployment](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics-cloud/get-started/quickstart/#creating-deployments) before sending data to it.
It is a fully managed service that allows you to deploy and manage your own instance of VictoriaMetrics 
in the cloud. Regular use cases of VictoriaMetrics Cloud are monitoring applications, infrastructure, or services,
running in different setups like on-prem, Private, Public or Hybrid Cloud, Edge devices or IoT.
