VictoriaMetrics Cloud is a hosted monitoring platform, where users can run the VictoriaMetrics 
that they know and love on AWS without the need to perform typical DevOps tasks such as proper configuration, 
monitoring, logs collection, access protection, software updates, backups, etc.

## Creating deployments

On the [Deployments](https://console.victoriametrics.cloud/deployments?utm_source=website&utm_campaign=docs_quickstart) page you 
will see a list of your existing deployments and will be able to manage them. 

To create a deployment click on the button `Start sending metrics` button:


  ![Create deployment start](create_deployment_start.webp)

When you already have at least one deployment you can create a new one by clicking on the `Create deployment` button:

   ![Create deployment continue](create_deployment_continue.webp)


On the opened screen, choose parameters of your new deployment:

* `Deployment name` – a unique name for your deployment;
* `Global settings` – choose between:
  * Single - for affordable, performant single-node deployments;
  * Cluster - for highly available and multi-tenant deployments;
  * Cloud provider - for deployments on AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.
  * Region - cloud provider region where deployment will run;
* `Tier and storage` – choose between:
  * [Tier](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics-cloud/tiers-parameters/) – predefined set of parameters for your deployment [based on your needs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/guides/understand-your-setup-size.html);
  * Retention – desired retention period for stored metrics;
  * Storage - desired storage capacity for storing metrics (you always can expand disk size later);
  
    We provide recommended capacity depends on how much data your ingestion rate and retention period involve, 
    as well as on the size of each data point. We assume each data point is 0.8 byte based on our experience 
    with VictoriaMetrics Cloud and take the ingestion rate and retention period from your deployment configuration.
    We suggest using the recommended capacity for retention periods of one month or less. 
    If you need to keep data longer (6 months or more), you can start with a smaller storage size and increase it over time.
    If you ingest high cardinality data, this increases the data point size, and you may need more storage than we recommend.
    Please note that while you can increase storage size, you cannot reduce it due to AWS limitations. 
    We charge $0.09 per GB-month for SSD storage.
    Since VictoriaMetrics Cloud doesn’t charge extra for storage, we recommend using enterprise features like [downsampling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling)
    and [retention filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#retention-filters) to optimize disk space.
    You can find the formula for calculating the recommended storage [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/guides/understand-your-setup-size/#retention-perioddisk-space).  
    Feel free to adjust parameters as needed.

* `Advanced settings` – additional parameters for your deployment:
  * `Deduplication` – defines interval when deployment leaves a single raw sample with the biggest timestamp per each discrete interval;
  * `Maintenance Window` – when deployment should start an upgrade process if needed;

Also see the [Tier Parameters and Flag Parameters Configuration](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics-cloud/tiers-parameters/).
This document provides an overview of tier parameters and predefined flag settings for VictoriaMetrics Cloud.


![Create deployment continue](create_deployment_form_up.webp)
![Create deployment continue](create_deployment_form_down.webp)


When all parameters are configured, click on the `Create` button, and deployment will be created.

Once created, deployment will remain for a short period of time in `PROVISIONING` status 
while the hardware spins-up, just wait for a couple of minutes and reload the page. 
You'll also be notified via email once your deployment is ready to use:


  ![Create deployment created](create_deployment_created.webp)



  ![Create deployment active email](create_deployment_active_email.webp)


## Start writing and reading data

After transition from `PROVISIONING` to `RUNNING` state, VictoriaMetrics Cloud deployment is fully operational 
and is ready to accept write and read requests. 

Click on deployment name and navigate to the Access tab to get the access token:


  ![Deployment access](deployment_access.webp)


Access tokens are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access the VictoriaMetrics API. 
Supported token types are `Read-Only`, `Write-Only` and `Read-Write`. Click on token created by default 
to see usage examples:


  ![Deployment access write example](deployment_access_write_example.webp)



  ![Deployment access read example](deployment_access_read_example.webp)


Follow usage examples in order to configure access to VictoriaMetrics for your Prometheus, 
Grafana or any other software.

## Modifying an existing deployment

Remember, you can always add, remove or modify existing deployment by changing its size or any parameters on the 
deployment's page. 
It is important to know that downgrade for cluster is currently not available.


  ![Modify deployment](modify_deployment.webp)

 
To discover additional configuration options click on `Advanced Settings` button, so you should see the following:


  ![Modify deployment additional settings](modify_deployment_additional_settings.webp)


In that section, additional params can be set:

* [`Deduplication`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/#deduplication) defines interval when deployment leaves a single raw sample with the biggest timestamp per each discrete interval;
* `Maintenance Window` when deployment should start an upgrade process if needed;
* `Settings` allow to define different flags for the deployment:

   1. [cluster components flags](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/#list-of-command-line-flags).
   2. [single version flags](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/#list-of-command-line-flags).

Please note, such an update requires a deployment restart and may result in a short downtime for single-node deployments.
