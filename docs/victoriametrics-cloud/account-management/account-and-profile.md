Upon registration, every user is assigned to a profile and a [role](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics-cloud/account-management/roles-and-permissions/).

If forgot your password, it can always be restored by clicking the `Forgot password?` link on the
[Sign In](https://console.victoriametrics.cloud/signIn?utm_source=website&utm_campaign=docs_quickstart) page.

If you need to change your authentication method, or need assistance, don't hesitate to contact our
support team at support-cloud@victoriametrics.com.
