VictoriaMetrics Cloud allows you to define and manage alerting rules using
[vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/), and send notifications through a fully managed
Alertmanager instance, built into the platform.

This integration provides a seamless way to trigger alerts based on Prometheus-compatible queries and
route them to your preferred notification channels, such as email, PagerDuty, Slack, MS Teams or webhooks.

## Integrating with Cloud AlertManager
