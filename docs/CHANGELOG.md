Metrics of the latest version of VictoriaMetrics cluster are available for viewing at our
[sandbox](https://play-grafana.victoriametrics.com/d/oS7Bi_0Wz_vm/victoriametrics-cluster-vm).
The sandbox cluster installation runs under the constant load generated by
[prometheus-benchmark](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/prometheus-benchmark) and is used for testing latest releases.

See also [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/).

## tip

**Update note 1: the `--vm-disable-progress-bar` command-line flag at `vmctl` was deprecated. Use `--disable-progress-bar` instead.**

**Update note 2: `*.passwordFile` and similar flags are no longer trimming trailing whitespaces at the end of content. Make sure to update the templating of password files or HTTP endpoints to not include trailing whitespaces before the upgrade. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6503) PR for the details.**

* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics components: use constant-time comparison for comparing HTTP basic auth credentials and auth keys. This should prevent timing attacks when comparing these credentials. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6392) for details. Thanks to @wasim-nihal for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6423).
* FEATURE: [alerts-vmagent](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/deployment/docker/alerts-vmagent.yml): add new alerting rules `StreamAggrFlushTimeout` and `StreamAggrDedupFlushTimeout` to notify about issues during stream aggregation.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/vmagent](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12683): add row `Streaming aggregation` with panels related to [streaming aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/) process.
* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): add `idleConnTimeout` flag set to 50s by default. It should reduce the probability of `broken pipe` or `connection reset by peer` errors in vmauth logs.
* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): add auto request retry for trivial network errors, such as `broken pipe` and `connection reset` for requests to the configured backends.
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): increase default value of `-promscrape.maxDroppedTargets` command-line flag to 10_000 from 1000. This makes it easier to track down large number of dropped targets.
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add `max_scrape_size` parameter to a scrape config for setting a custom scrape limit for a job. The new [automatically generated metric](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#automatically-generated-metrics) `scrape_response_size_bytes` was added to reflect the response size of the target.
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/): check for ranged vector arguments in non-rollup expressions when `-search.disableImplicitConversion` or `-search.logImplicitConversion` are enabled. For example, `sum(up[5m])` or `absent(up[5m])` will fail to execute if these flags are set.
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/): validate that rollup expressions has ranged vector arguments passed when `-search.disableImplicitConversion` or `-search.logImplicitConversion` are enabled. For example, `rate(metric)` or `count_over_time(metric)` will fail to execute if these flags are set.
* FEATURE: [vmalert-tool](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert-tool/): support file path with hierarchical patterns and regexpes, and http url in unittest cmd-line flag `-files`, e.g. `-files="http://<some-server-addr>/path/to/rules"` or `-files="dir/**/*.yaml"`.

* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics components: prioritize `-configAuthKey` and `-reloadAuthKey` over `-httpAuth.*` settings. This change aligns behavior of mentioned flags with other auth flags like `-metricsAuthKey`, `-flagsAuthKey`, `-pprofAuthKey`. Check [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6329).
* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics components: do not trim trailing spaces when reading content from `*.passwordFile` and similar flags. Previously, trailing spaces were trimmed from the content of the password file, which could lead to unexpected authentication errors.
* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): add `--disable-progress-bar` global command-line flag. It can be used for disabling dynamic progress bar for all migration modes. `--vm-disable-progress-bar`  command-line flag is deprecated and will be removed in the future releases. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6367).
* BUGFIX: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): prevent [rate_sum](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#rate_sum) and [rate_avg](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#rate_avg) producing `NaN` results for stale time series. Before, when series matched for aggregation became stale or weren't updated during aggregation interval, the `rate_sum` or `rate_avg` could produce data point with `NaN` value. During visualization, such aggregation results would be displayed as gaps in time series.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): fix path for system links printed on default vmalert's UI page when `-http.pathPrefix` is set.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): exit replay mode with non-zero code if generated samples are not successfully written into remoteWrite url. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6512).
* BUGFIX: [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup/): properly configure authentication with S3 when `-configFilePath` cmd-line flag is specified.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/) enterprise: properly configure authentication with S3 when `-s3.configFilePath` cmd-line flag is specified for reading rule configs.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): properly specify oauth2 `ClientSecret` when configuring authentication for `notifier.url`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6471) for details. Thanks to @yincongcyincong for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6478).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): add validation for the max value specified for `-retentionPeriod`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6330) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): calculate the exact number of [raw samples](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#raw-samples) during query processing, the limit is specified via command-line flag `-search.maxSamplesPerQuery`. Previously, samples could have been over-counted and lead to false-positive errors of `maxSamplesPerQuery`limit exceeded. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5851).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): **copy row** button in Table view produces unexpected result. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6421) and [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6495).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert-tool](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert-tool/): prevent hanging when processing groups without rules. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6500).

## [v1.102.0-rc1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.102.0-rc1)

Released at 2024-06-07

**Update note 1: the `-remoteWrite.multitenantURL` command-line flag at `vmagent` was removed starting from this release. This flag was deprecated since [v1.96.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.96.0). Use `-enableMultitenantHandlers` instead, as it is easier to use and combine with [multitenant URL at vminsert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#multitenancy-via-labels). See these [docs for details](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#multitenancy).**

**Update note 2: the `-streamAggr.dropInputLabels` command-line flag at `vmagent` was renamed to `-remoteWrite.streamAggr.dropInputLabels`. `-streamAggr.dropInputLabels` is now used for global streaming aggregation.**

**Update note 3: the `-maxLabelValueLen` command-line flag default value was changed from 16kB to 1kB. It may lead to truncating of labels with enormous values.**

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.22.2 to Go1.22.4. See the list of issues addressed in [Go1.22.3](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.22.3+label%3ACherryPickApproved) and [Go1.22.4](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.22.4+label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add labels `path` and `url` to metrics `vmagent_remotewrite_push_failures_total` and `vmagent_remotewrite_samples_dropped_total`. Now number of failed pushes and dropped samples can be tracked per `-remoteWrite.url`.
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): support Statsd plaintext protocol. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#how-to-push-data-to-vmagent) and this [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5053). Thanks to @Koilanetroc for implementation!
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): add [rate_sum](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#rate_sum) and [rate_avg](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#rate_avg) aggregation outputs.
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): reduce the number of allocated objects in heap during deduplication and aggregation. The change supposed to reduce pressure on Garbage Collector, as it will need to scan less objects. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6402).
* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): add `datasource.idleConnTimeout`, `remoteWrite.idleConnTimeout` and `remoteRead.idleConnTimeout` flags. These flags are set to 50s by default and should reduce the probability of `broken pipe` or `connection reset by peer` errors in vmalert logs.

For example, `-remoteWrite.url=http://srv+victoria-metrics` automatically resolves the `victoria-metrics` DNS SRV to a list of hostnames with TCP ports and then sends data to one of the addresses. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6053).
* FEATURE: [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup/), [vmrestore](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmrestore/), [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager/): add `-s3TLSInsecureSkipVerify` command-line flag for skipping TLS certificates verification when connecting to S3 endpoint.
* FEATURE: expose metric `vm_indexdb_items_dropped_total` to track the number of IndexDB records that had to be dropped during ingestion. The reason of dropping the record will be annotated in `reason` label of the exposed metric. This change also comes with a new [alerting rule](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/deployment/docker/alerts-health.yml) to track changes of this metric.
* FEATURE: [alerts-health](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/deployment/docker/alerts-health.yml): add new alerting rules `TooLongLabelValues` and `TooLongLabelNames` to notify about truncation of label values or names respectively. 
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): expose `vm_streamaggr_ignored_samples_total` [counters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#counter) at [`/metrics` page](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#monitoring), which can be used for detecting amount of too old or NaN valued ignored samples. Expose also `vm_streamaggr_samples_lag_seconds` [histogram](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#histogram) to monitor aggregated samples lag.
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): improve filtering speed of the received data samples if [match](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#stream-aggregation-config) field is matching only [metric name](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#structure-of-a-metric).
* FEATURE: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): adds `-relabelConfigCheckInterval` flag and `/-/reload` endpoint for reloading relabeling rules. See this [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/3923) for details.

* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix bug that prevents the first query trace from expanding on click event.

* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix handling of URL params for browser history navigation (back and forward buttons). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6126) and [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5516#issuecomment-1867507232).
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): prevent potential panic during [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation.html) if more than one `--remoteWrite.streamAggr.dedupInterval` is configured. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6205).
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): skip empty data blocks before sending to the remote write destination. Thanks to @viperstars for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6241).
* BUGFIX: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): set correct suffix `<output>_prometheus` for aggregation outputs [increase_prometheus](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#increase_prometheus) and [total_prometheus](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#total_prometheus). Before, outputs `total` and `total_prometheus` or `increase` and `increase_prometheus` had the same suffix.
* BUGFIX: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): prevent from excessive resource usage when stream aggregation config file is empty. 
* BUGFIX: properly estimate the needed memory for query execution if it has the format [`aggr_func`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#aggregate-functions)([`rollup_func[d]`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#rollup-functions) (for example, `sum(rate(request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))`). This should allow performing aggregations over bigger number of time series when VictoriaMetrics runs in environments with small amounts of available memory. The issue has been introduced in [this commit](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/commit/5138eaeea0791caa34bcfab410e0ca9cd253cd8f) in [v1.83.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog_2022/#v1830).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): correctly apply `-inmemoryDataFlushInterval` when it's set to minimum supported value 1s.
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): reduce the default value for `-maxLabelValueLen` command-line flag from `16KiB` to `1KiB`. This should prevent from issues like [this one](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6176) when time series with too long labels are ingested into VictoriaMetrics.
* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): properly release memory used for metrics during config reload. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6247).
* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): fix discovering backend IPs when `url_prefix` contains hostname with srv+ prefix. Thanks to @shichanglin5 for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6401).

* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): filter deleted label names and values from [`/api/v1/labels`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/url-examples/#apiv1labels) and [`/api/v1/label/.../values`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/url-examples/#apiv1labelvalues) responses when `match[]` filter matches small number of time series. The issue was introduced [v1.81.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog_2022/#v1810).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert-tool](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert-tool/): fix float values template in `input_series`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6391).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): fix misleading error logs in vmalert's stdout when unsupported HTTP path is requested.
* BUGFIX: retry files delete attempts on vXFS file system for `EEXIST` error type. See the [related issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6396). Thanks to @pludov for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6398).

* DEPRECATION: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): removed deprecated `-remoteWrite.multitenantURL` flag from vmagent. This flag was deprecated since [v1.96.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.96.0). Use `-enableMultitenantHandlers` instead, as it is easier to use and combine with [multitenant URL at vminsert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#multitenancy-via-labels). See these [docs for details](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#multitenancy).

## [v1.101.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.101.0)

Released at 2024-04-26

* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): support filtering by multiple numeric constants via `q == (C1, ..., CN)` and `q != (C1, ..., CN)` syntax. For example, `status_code == (200, 201, 300)` returns `status_code` metrics with any of `200`, `201` or `300` values, while `status_code != (400, 404, 500)` returns `status_code` metrics with all the values except of `400`, `404` and `500`.
* FEATURE: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): add support for fault domain awareness to `vmselect`. It can be configured to return full responses if up to `-globalReplicationFactor - 1` fault domains (aka `vmstorage` groups) are unavailable. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6054) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/#vmstorage-groups-at-vmselect).
* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/) components: add support for automatic issuing of TLS certificates for HTTPS server at `-httpListenAddr` via [Let's Encrypt service](https://letsencrypt.org/). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#automatic-issuing-of-tls-certificates) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5949).
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/): support disable or log [implicit conversions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#implicit-query-conversions) for subquery with cmd-line flags `-search.disableImplicitConversion` and `-search.logImplicitConversion`. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4338).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): support data replication additionally to sharding among remote storage systems if `-remoteWrite.shardByURLReplicas=N` command-line flag is set additionally to `-remoteWrite.shardByURL` command-line flag, where `N` is desired replication factor. This allows setting up data replication among failure domains when the replication factor is smaller than the number of failure domains. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#sharding-among-remote-storages) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6054).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): reduce CPU usage when [sharding among remote storage systems](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#sharding-among-remote-storages) is enabled.
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): reduce memory usage during stream aggregation if multiple aggregation configs are used for the same set of data.
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): support [DNS SRV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record) addresses in `-remoteWrite.url` command-line option and in scrape target urls. For example, `-remoteWrite.url=http://srv+victoria-metrics/api/v1/write` automatically resolves the `victoria-metrics` DNS SRV to a list of hostnames with TCP ports and then sends the collected metrics to these TCP addresses. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#srv-urls) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6053).
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): allow skipping first N aggregation intervals via cmd-line flag `-streamAggr.ignoreFirstIntervals` for [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) or `-remoteWrite.streamAggr.ignoreFirstIntervals` for [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/). See more details [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#ignore-aggregation-intervals-on-start).
* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): support automatic discovering and load balancing for TCP addresses behind DNS SRV addresses. These addresses can be put inside `url_prefix` urls in the form `http://srv+addr/path`, where the `addr` is the [DNS SRV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record) address, which is automatically resolved to hostnames with TCP ports. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#srv-urls) for details.
* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): support specifying client TLS certificates and TLS ServerName for requests to HTTPS backends. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#backend-tls-setup).
* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): support regex matching when routing incoming requests based on HTTP [query args](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) via `src_query_args` option at `url_map`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#generic-http-proxy-for-different-backends) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6070).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): optimize auto-suggestion performance for metric names when the database contains big number of unique time series.
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): in the Select component, user-entered values are now preserved on blur if they match options in the list.
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): auto-suggestion triggers at any cursor position in the query input. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5864).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): update error messages on the Query page for enhanced clarity. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6177).

* BUGFIX: [downsampling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling): skip unnecessary index lookups if downsampling wasn't set for ENT versions of VictoriaMetrics. Before, users of VictoriaMetrics ENT could have experience elevated CPU usage even if no downsampling was configured. The issue was introduced in [v1.100.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v11000).  
* BUGFIX: [downsampling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling): properly populate downsampling metadata for data parts created by VictoriaMetrics ENT versions lower than v1.100.0. The bug could trigger the downsampling actions for parts that were downsampled already. This bug doesn't have any negative effect apart from spending extra CPU resources on the repeated downsampling. The issue was introduced in [v1.100.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v11000). 
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): supported any status codes from the range 200-299 from alertmanager. Previously, only 200 status code considered a successful action. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6110).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): avoid blocking `/api/v1/rules`, `/api/v1/alerts`, `/metrics` APIs when alerting rule uses template functions `query`, which could takes a while to execute. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6079).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): fix links with anchors in vmalert's UI. Starting from [v1.99.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.99.0) vmalert could ignore anchors pointing to specific rule groups if `search` param was present in URL.
* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): don't treat concurrency limit hit as an error of the backend. Previously, hitting the concurrency limit would increment both `vmauth_concurrent_requests_limit_reached_total` and `vmauth_user_request_backend_errors_total` counters. Now, only concurrency limit counter is incremented. Updates [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5565).

## [v1.100.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.100.1)

Released at 2024-04-11

**Update note 1: This release contains the issue which could lead to extra CPU usage of storage component in ENT distribution of VictoriaMetrics. The issue is caused by [downsampling per distinct sets of time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling) feature introduced in 1.100.0 ENT version. Please, upgrade to [v1.101.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v11010) or rollback to [v1.98.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1980) ENT version if you're affected.**

* FEATURE: [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager/): allow specifying custom backup interval via `-backupInterval` command-line flag. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5966).

* BUGFIX: properly register new entries in IndexDB when many new time series are ingested into VictoriaMetrics in a short period of time. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5959) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6069) issues. The bug has been introduced in [v1.99.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.99.0).
* BUGFIX: [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager/): fix panic when performing a restore from GCS. Previously, filters for GCS objects were not properly set which caused objects to be returned instead of prefixes.

## [v1.100.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.100.0)

Released at 2024-04-04

**This release contains [the issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5959), which can prevent from storing data for new time series under high rate of search queries. Please rollback to [v1.98.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1980) or upgrade to [v1.101.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.101.0).**

**Update note 1: the `-datasource.lookback` command-line flag at `vmalert` is no-op starting from this release. This flag will be removed in the future, so please switch to [`eval_delay` option](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/#groups). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5155) for more details.**

* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): add ability to read auth tokens from arbitrary HTTP request headers via `-httpAuthHeader` command-line flag. Previously auth tokens were read only from `Authorization` HTTP request header. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#reading-auth-tokens-from-other-http-headers) for details.
* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): add ability to authorize by opaque HTTP request header value via `auth_token` option in [-auth.config](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#auth-config).
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): reduce memory usage by up to 5x when aggregating over big number of unique [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#time-series). The memory usage reduction is most visible when [stream deduplication](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#deduplication) is enabled.
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): allow using `-streamAggr.dedupInterval` and `-remoteWrite.streamAggr.dedupInterval` command-line flags without the need to specify `-streamAggr.config` and `-remoteWrite.streamAggr.config`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#deduplication).
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): add `-streamAggr.dropInputLabels` command-line flag, which can be used for dropping the listed labels from input samples before applying stream [de-duplication](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#deduplication) and aggregation. This is faster and easier to use alternative to [input_relabel_configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#relabeling). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#dropping-unneeded-labels).
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): add `dedup_interval` option, which allows configuring individual [deduplication intervals](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#deduplication) per each [stream aggregation config](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#stream-aggregation-config).
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): use the same logic in [stream deduplication](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#deduplication) as in [the deduplication at VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#deduplication). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5643).

* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): add an ability to ignore input samples with old timestamps outside the current aggregation interval. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#ignoring-old-samples) for details.
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): add `keep_metric_names` option, which can be set at [stream aggregation config](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#stream-aggregation-config) in order to keep the original metric names in the output aggregated samples instead of using [the default output metric naming scheme](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#output-metric-names).
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): align the time of aggregated data flush to the specified aggregation `interval`. For example, if `interval` is set to `1m`, then the aggregated data will be flushed at the end of every minute. The alignment can be disabled by setting `no_align_flush_to_interval: true` option at [stream aggregation config](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#stream-aggregation-config). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#flush-time-alignment) for details.
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): add [unique_samples](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#unique_samples) output, which can be used for calculating the number of unique sample values over the given `interval`.
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): add [increase_prometheus](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#increase_prometheus) and [total_prometheus](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#total_prometheus) outputs, which can be used for `increase` and `total` aggregations when the first sample of every new [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#time-series) must be ignored.
* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): expose `vm_streamaggr_flush_timeouts_total` and `vm_streamaggr_dedup_flush_timeouts_total` [counters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#counter) at [`/metrics` page](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#monitoring), which can be used for detecting flush timeouts for stream aggregation states. Expose also `vm_streamaggr_flush_duration_seconds` and `vm_streamaggr_dedup_flush_duration_seconds` [histograms](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#histogram) for monitoring the real flush durations of stream aggregation states.
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): improve trace display for better visual separation of branches. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5926).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): ability to limit the ingestion rate via `-maxIngestionRate` command-line flag. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5900). 
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): use the provided `-remoteWrite.tlsServerName` as `Host` header in requests to `-remoteWrite.url`. This allows sending data to https remote storage by IP address instead of hostname. Thanks to @minor-fixes for initial idea and [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5802).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): add `-remoteWrite.shardByURL.ignoreLabels` command-line flag, which can be used for specifying the ignored list of labels when [sharding by `-remoteWrite.url` is enabled](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#sharding-among-remote-storages).

* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): automatically reload updated root CA certificates from files without the need to restart `vmagent`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5526).
* FEATURE: optimize [`/api/v1/labels`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/url-examples/#apiv1labels) and [`/api/v1/label/.../values`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/url-examples/#apiv1labelvalues) when `match[]` filters contains metric name. For example, `/api/v1/label/instance/values?match[]=up` now works much faster than before. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5055).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): accept Prometheus remote write protocol data at `/api/v1/push` endpoint. This simplifies writing data to `vmagent` from Grafana Mimir. Thanks to @edma2 for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5990).
* FEATURE: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): support client-side TLS configuration for [native protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#migrating-data-from-victoriametrics). See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5748). Thanks to @khushijain21 for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5824).
* FEATURE: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): support client-side TLS configuration for VictoriaMetrics destination specified via `--vm-*` cmd-line flags used in [InfluxDB](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#migrating-data-from-influxdb-1x), [Remote Read protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#migrating-data-by-remote-read-protocol), [OpenTSDB](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#migrating-data-from-opentsdb), [Prometheus](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#migrating-data-from-prometheus) and [Promscale](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#migrating-data-from-promscale) migration modes.
* FEATURE: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): split [explore phase](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#migrating-data-from-victoriametrics) in `vm-native` mode by time intervals when [--vm-native-step-interval](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#using-time-based-chunking-of-migration) is specified. This should reduce probability of exceeding complexity limits for number of selected series during explore phase. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5369).
* FEATURE: [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway/): add `-logInvalidAuthTokens` command-line flag, which can be used for logging invalid auth tokens. This is useful for debugging of auth token format issues. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6029).
* FEATURE: [graphite](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#graphite-render-api-usage): add support for [aggregateSeriesLists](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#graphite.render.functions.aggregateSeriesLists), [diffSeriesLists](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#graphite.render.functions.diffSeriesLists), [multiplySeriesLists](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#graphite.render.functions.multiplySeriesLists) and [sumSeriesLists](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#graphite.render.functions.sumSeriesLists) functions. Thanks to @rbizos for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5809).
* FEATURE: [OpenTelemetry](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#sending-data-via-opentelemetry): add `-opentelemetry.usePrometheusNaming` command-line flag, which can be used for enabling automatic conversion of the ingested metric names and labels into Prometheus-compatible format. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#sending-data-via-opentelemetry) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6037).

* BUGFIX: prevent from automatic deletion of newly registered time series when it is queried immediately after the addition. The probability of this bug has been increased significantly after [v1.99.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.99.0) because of optimizations related to registering new time series. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5948) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5959) issue.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly set `Host` header in requests to scrape targets if it is specified via [`headers` option](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#http-api-client-options). Thanks to @fholzer for [the bugreport](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5969) and [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5970).
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly set `Host` header in requests to scrape targets when [`server_name` option at `tls_config`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#tls_config) is set. Previously the `Host` header was set incorrectly to the target hostname in this case.
* BUGFIX: do not drop `match[]` filter at [`/api/v1/series`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/url-examples/#apiv1series) if `-search.ignoreExtraFiltersAtLabelsAPI` command-line flag is set, since missing `match[]` filter breaks `/api/v1/series` requests.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): return proper responses for [AWS Firehose](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html#requestformat) requests according to [these docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html#responseformat). See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6016) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6037).
* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): properly parse TLS key and CA files for [InfluxDB](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#migrating-data-from-influxdb-1x) and [OpenTSDB](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#migrating-data-from-opentsdb) migration modes.
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix VictoriaLogs UI query handling to correctly apply `_time` filter across all queries. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5920).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix issue where `step` parameter wasn't updated after moving the focus outside the `step` input field in Firefox.
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix freezing when pasting a query with autocomplete enabled. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5923).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix auto-suggestion trigger issue after whitespace char. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5866).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): limit duration of requests to /api/v1/labels, /api/v1/label/.../values or /api/v1/series with `-search.maxLabelsAPIDuration` duration. Before, `-search.maxExportDuration` value was used by mistake. The bug has been introduced in [v1.99.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.99.0). Thanks to @kbweave for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5992).
* BUGFIX: properly wait for force merge to be completed during the shutdown. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5944) for the details.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): set correct `endsAt` value in notifications sent to the Alertmanager. Previously, a rule with evaluation intervals lower than 10s could never be triggered. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5995) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): properly account for `-rule.resendDelay` for alerting rules that are constantly switching state from inactive to firing. Before, notifications for such rules could have been skipped if state change happened more often than `-rule.resendDelay`. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6028) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): respect `-remoteWrite.maxBatchSize` at shutdown period. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6025). Thanks to @jiekun for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6039).

## [v1.99.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.99.0)

Released at 2024-03-01

**This release contains [the issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5959), which can prevent from storing data for new time series under high rate of search queries. Please rollback to [v1.98.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1980) or upgrade to [v1.101.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.101.0).**

* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): propagate [label filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#filtering) via all the [label manipulation functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#label-manipulation-functions). For example, `label_del(some_metric{job="foo"}, "instance") + other_metric{pod="bar"}` is now transformed to `label_del(some_metric{job="foo",pod="bar"}, "instance") + other_metric{job="foo",pod="bar"}`. This should reduce the amounts of time series processed during query execution.
* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): add [count_values_over_time](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#count_values_over_time) function. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5847).
* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): expose `vm_last_partition_parts` [metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#monitoring), which show the number of [parts in the latest partition](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#storage). These metrics may help debugging query performance slowdown related to the increased number of parts in the last partition, since usually all the ingested data is written to the last partition and all the queries are performed over the recently ingested data, e.g. the last partition.
* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): expose `vm_snapshots` [metric](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#monitoring), which shows the current number of snapshots created via [snapshot API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-work-with-snapshots).

* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): add support for `enable_compression` option in [scrape_configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#scrape_configs) in order to be compatible with Prometheus scrape configs. See [this pull request](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/13166) and [this feature request](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/12319). Note that `vmagent` was always supporting [`disable_compression` option](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#scrape_config-enhancements) before Prometheus added `enable_compression` option.
* FEATURE: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): support client-side TLS configuration for [InfluxDB](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#migrating-data-from-influxdb-1x), [Remote Read protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#migrating-data-by-remote-read-protocol) and [OpenTSDB](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#migrating-data-from-opentsdb).

See [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5791) by @victoramsantos.
* FEATURE: [docker-compose](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker#docker-compose-environment-for-victoriametrics): create a separate [docker-compose environment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/deployment/docker/docker-compose-victorialogs.yml) for VictoriaLogs installation, including fluentbit and [VictoriaLogs Grafana datasource](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource). See [these docs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker#victorialogs-server) for details.
* FEATURE: [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager/): wait for up 30 seconds before making a [snapshot](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-work-with-snapshots) for backup if `vmstorage` is temporarily unavailable. This should prevent from `vmbackupmanager` termination in this case. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5859).

* BUGFIX: downgrade Go builder from `1.22.0` to `1.21.7`, since `1.22.0` contains [the bug](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/65705), which can lead to deadlocked HTTP connections to remote storage systems, scrape targets and service discovery endpoints at [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/). This may result in incorrect service discovery, target scraping and failed sending samples to remote storage.
* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics components: return back periodic closing of incoming connections to `-httpListenAddr` every 2 minutes, which was disabled in [v1.98.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.98.0) when addressing [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1304#issuecomment-1636997037). See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1304#issuecomment-1961891450) for details on why the periodic closing of incoming connections has been returned back.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): accept OpenTelemetry data at `/opentelemetry/v1/metrics`, since the `/v1/metrics` suffix is hardcoded at [OpenTelemetry protocol specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp-request).
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): fix possible deadlock when [sharding among remote storages](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#sharding-among-remote-storages) is enabled with `-remoteWrite.shardByURL` command-line flag. Thanks to @penguinlav for [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5834) for [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5833).
* BUGFIX: fix the misleading error `0ms is out of allowed range [0 ...` when passing `step=0` to [/api/v1/query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#instant-query) or [/api/v1/query_range](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#range-query). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5795).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): fixed floating-point error when parsing time in RFC3339 format. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5801) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmalert): consistently sort groups by name and filename on `/groups` page in UI. This should prevent non-deterministic sorting for groups with identical names.
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix Popper display issues. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5842).
* BUGFIX: [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/): format time with milliseconds precision when `__timestamp__:rfc3339` is specified for [/api/v1/export/csv](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-export-csv-data) API response. See this [issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5837) for details.
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly construct the destination label in [label_join](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#label_join) if it is used as source label. See this [issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5881) for details.

## [v1.98.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.98.0)

Released at 2024-02-14

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.21.6 to Go1.22.0. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.21.7](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.21.7+label%3ACherryPickApproved),
  plus [the changelog for Go1.22.0](https://go.dev/doc/go1.22).

* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics components: add support for TLS client certificate verification at `-httpListenAddr` (aka [mTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication)). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#mtls-protection) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5458).
* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics components: add support for accepting http requests over multiple distinct TCP addresses. This can be done by starting VictoriaMetrics component with multiple `-httpListenAddr` command-line flags. For example, `./victoria-metrics -httpListenAddr=some-host:12345 -httpListenAddr=localhost:8428` starts VictoriaMetrics, which accepts incoming http requests at both `some-host:12345` and `localhost:8428`. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1470).
* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics components: add support for empty command-line flag values in short array notation. For example, `-remoteWrite.sendTimeout=',20s,'` specifies three `-remoteWrite.sendTimeout` values - the first one and the last one have default values (`30s` in this case), while the second one is set to `20s`.
* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): add support for [mTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication)-based request routing to different backends depending on the subject of the TLS certificate provided by the client. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#mtls-based-request-routing) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1547).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/) and [single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com): add support for data ingestion via [DataDog lambda extension](https://docs.datadoghq.com/serverless/libraries_integrations/extension/) aka `/api/beta/sketches` endpoint. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-send-data-from-datadog-agent) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3091). Thanks to @AndrewChubatiuk for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5584).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): add `-remoteWrite.tlsHandshakeTimeout` command-line flag for tuning the timeout needed for establishing TLS connections to `-remoteWrite.url`. Bigger tls handshake timeouts should reduce the probability of `http: TLS handshake error from ...: EOF` errors at the remote storage side under high load. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1699).
* FEATURE: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): add `-disableReroutingOnUnavailable` command-line flag to `vminsert`, which can be used for reducing resource usage spikes at `vmstorage` nodes during rolling restart. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/#improving-re-routing-performance-during-restart). Thanks to @Muxa1L for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5713).
* FEATURE: add `-search.resetRollupResultCacheOnStartup` command-line flag for resetting [query cache](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#rollup-result-cache) on startup. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/834).
* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): propagate label filters across [label_set](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#label_set) and [alias](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#alias) functions. For example, `label_set(q1, "a", "b") + q2{c="d"}` is automatically transformed to `label_set(q1{c="d"}, "a", "b") + q2{a="b",c="d"}` now. This should improve performance for such queries. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1827#issuecomment-1654095358).
* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): add [sum_eq_over_time](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#sum_eq_over_time), [sum_gt_over_time](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#sum_gt_over_time) and [sum_le_over_time](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#sum_le_over_time) functions. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4641).
* FEATURE: [dashboards/vmagent](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12683): add `Targets scraped/s` stat panel showing the number of targets scraped by the vmagent per-second.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/all](https://grafana.com/orgs/victoriametrics): add new panel `CPU spent on GC`. It should help identifying cases when too much CPU is spent on garbage collection, and advice users on how this can be addressed.
* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmalert): support [filtering](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/2.49/querying/api/#rules) for `/api/v1/rules` API. See [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5749) by @victoramsantos.
* FEATURE: [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup/): support client-side TLS configuration for creating and deleting snapshots via `-snapshot.tls*` cmd-line flags. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5724). Thanks to @khushijain21 for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5738).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add a time picker to the "Logs Explorer" page. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5673).

* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics components: do not close connections to `-httpListenAddr` every 2 minutes. This behavior didn't help spreading load among multiple backend servers behind load-balancing TCP proxy. Instead, it could lead to hard-to-debug issues like [this one](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1304#issuecomment-1636997037). If you still need periodically closing client connections because of some reason, then pass the desired timeout to `-http.connTimeout` command-line flag.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): reduce CPU usage when `-promscrape.dropOriginalLabels` command-line flag is set. This issue has been introduced in [v1.96.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.96.0) when addressing [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5389).
* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): properly release memory during config reload. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4690).
* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): properly expose `vmauth_unauthorized_user_concurrent_requests_capacity`, `vmauth_unauthorized_user_concurrent_requests_current`, `vmauth_user_concurrent_requests_capacity` and `vmauth_user_concurrent_requests_current` [metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#monitoring) after [config reload](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#config-reload). Previously these metrics didn't work after config reload.
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly propagate [label filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#filtering) from multiple arguments passed to [aggregate functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#aggregate-functions). For example, `sum({job="foo"}, {job="bar"}) by (job) + a` was improperly optimized to `sum({job="foo"}, {job="bar"}) by (job) + a{job="foo"}` before being executed. This could lead to unexpected results. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5604).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly handle precision errors when calculating [changes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#changes), [changes_prometheus](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#changes_prometheus), [increases_over_time](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#increases_over_time) and [resets](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#resets) functions. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/767).
* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics components: consistently return 200 http status code from [`/-/reload` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#configuration-update). Previously [single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) was returning 204 http status code. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5774).
* BUGFIX: properly store [staleness markers](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#prometheus-staleness-markers) for [self-scraped metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#monitoring) on single-node VictoriaMetrics shutdown. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/943).
* BUGFIX: prevent from possible `too big indexBlockSize` panic when samples with too long label values (~64Kb) are ingested into VictoriaMetrics.
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix the graph dragging for Firefox and Safari. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5764).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix handling invalid timezone. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5732).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix the bug where the select does not open. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5728).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): clear entered text in select after selecting a value. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5727).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): improve the operation of the context for autocomplete. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5736), [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5737) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5739) issues.
* BUGFIX: [dashboards](https://grafana.com/orgs/victoriametrics): update `Storage full ETA` panels for Single-node and Cluster dashboards to prevent them from showing negative or blank results caused by increase of deduplicated samples. Deduplicated samples were part of the expression to provide a better estimate for disk usage, but due to sporadic nature of [deduplication](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#deduplication) in VictoriaMetrics it rather produced skewed results. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5747).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmalert): reduce memory usage for ENT version of vmalert for configurations with high number of groups with enabled multitenancy.

See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6028) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): respect `-remoteWrite.maxBatchSize` at shutdown period. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6025). Thanks to @jiekun for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6039).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): supported any status codes from the range 200-299 from alertmanager. Previously, only 200 status code considered a successful action. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6110).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): avoid blocking `/api/v1/rules`, `/api/v1/alerts`, `/metrics` APIs when alerting rule uses template functions `query`, which could takes a while to execute. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6079).
* BUGFIX: [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager/): fix panic when performing a restore from GCS. Previously, filters for GCS objects were not properly set which caused objects to be returned instead of prefixes.

## [v1.97.3](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.97.3)

Released at 2024-03-01

**v1.97.x is a line of [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/). It contains important up-to-date bugfixes for [VictoriaMetrics enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/).
All these fixes are also included in [the latest community release](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest).
The v1.97.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.97.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1970) release**

* BUGFIX: downgrade Go builder from `1.22.0` to `1.21.7`, since `1.22.0` contains [the bug](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/65705), which can lead to deadlocked HTTP connections to remote storage systems, scrape targets and service discovery endpoints at [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/). This may result in incorrect service discovery, target scraping and failed sending samples to remote storage.
* BUGFIX: take into account `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` limit at [/api/v1/labels](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/url-examples/#apiv1labels), [/api/v1/label/.../values](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/url-examples/#apiv1labelvalues) and [/api/v1/series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/url-examples/#apiv1series). This limit was ignored at these endpoints starting from [v1.97.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.97.0) when trying to address [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5055). It has been appeared that this can result in high CPU usage when heavyweight queries hit these endpoints. This can prevent from executing lightweight queries to these endpoints. It is better to return `limit exceeded` error to heavyweight queries instead of burning CPU.
* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics components: return back periodic closing of incoming connections to `-httpListenAddr` every 2 minutes, which was disabled in [v1.97.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.97.2) when addressing [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1304#issuecomment-1636997037). See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1304#issuecomment-1961891450) for details on why the periodic closing of incoming connections has been returned back.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): accept OpenTelemetry data at `/opentelemetry/v1/metrics`, since the `/v1/metrics` suffix is hardcoded at [OpenTelemetry protocol specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp-request).
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): fix possible deadlock when [sharding among remote storages](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#sharding-among-remote-storages) is enabled with `-remoteWrite.shardByURL` command-line flag. Thanks to @penguinlav for [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5834) for [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5833).
* BUGFIX: fix the misleading error `0ms is out of allowed range [0 ...` when passing `step=0` to [/api/v1/query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#instant-query)
  or [/api/v1/query_range](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#range-query). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5795).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): fixed floating-point error when parsing time in RFC3339 format. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5801) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmalert): consistently sort groups by name and filename on `/groups` page in UI. This should prevent non-deterministic sorting for groups with identical names.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmalert): reduce memory usage for ENT version of vmalert for configurations with high number of groups with enabled multitenancy.
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly construct the destination label in [label_join](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#label_join) if it is used as source label. See this [issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5881) for details.

## [v1.97.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.97.2)

Released at 2024-02-14

**v1.97.x is a line of [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/). It contains important up-to-date bugfixes for [VictoriaMetrics enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/).
All these fixes are also included in [the latest community release](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest).
The v1.97.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.97.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1970) release**

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.21.6 to Go1.22.0. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.21.7](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.21.7+label%3ACherryPickApproved),
  plus [the changelog for Go1.22.0](https://go.dev/doc/go1.22).

* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics components: do not close connections to `-httpListenAddr` every 2 minutes. This behavior didn't help spreading load among multiple backend servers behind load-balancing TCP proxy. Instead, it could lead to hard-to-debug issues like [this one](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1304#issuecomment-1636997037). If you still need periodically closing client connections because of some reason, then pass the desired timeout to `-http.connTimeout` command-line flag.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): reduce CPU usage when `-promscrape.dropOriginalLabels` command-line flag is set. This issue has been introduced in [v1.96.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.96.0) when addressing [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5389).
* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): properly release memory during config reload. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4690).
* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): properly expose `vmauth_unauthorized_user_concurrent_requests_capacity`, `vmauth_unauthorized_user_concurrent_requests_current`, `vmauth_user_concurrent_requests_capacity` and `vmauth_user_concurrent_requests_current` [metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#monitoring) after [config reload](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#config-reload). Previously these metrics didn't work after config reload.
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly propagate [label filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#filtering) from multiple arguments passed to [aggregate functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#aggregate-functions). For example, `sum({job="foo"}, {job="bar"}) by (job) + a` was improperly optimized to `sum({job="foo"}, {job="bar"}) by (job) + a{job="foo"}` before being executed. This could lead to unexpected results. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5604).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly handle precision errors when calculating [changes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#changes), [changes_prometheus](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#changes_prometheus), [increases_over_time](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#increases_over_time) and [resets](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#resets) functions. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/767).
* BUGFIX: properly store [staleness markers](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#prometheus-staleness-markers) for [self-scraped metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#monitoring) on single-node VictoriaMetrics shutdown. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/943).
* BUGFIX: prevent from possible `too big indexBlockSize` panic when samples with too long label values (~64Kb) are ingested into VictoriaMetrics.

## [v1.97.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.97.1)

Released at 2024-02-01

**v1.97.x is a line of [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/). It contains important up-to-date bugfixes for [VictoriaMetrics enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/).
All these fixes are also included in [the latest community release](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest).
The v1.97.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.97.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1970) release**

* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): add support for `username_file` option at `basic_auth` section in [`scrape_configs`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#http-api-client-options). See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5511). Thanks to @wasim-nihal for [the initial implementation](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5720).

* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): fix the increased CPU usage when sending the data to remote storage. The issue has been introduced in [v1.97.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.97.0).
* BUGFIX: fix `runtime error: slice bounds out of range` panic, which can occur during query execution. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5733). The bug has been introduced in `v1.97.0`.
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly handle `avg_over_time({some_filter}[d]) keep_metric_names` queries, where [`some_filter`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#filtering) matches multiple time series with multiple names, while `d` is bigger or equal to `3h`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5556).
* BUGFIX: [dashboards/single](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10229): fix typo in query for `version` annotation which falsely produced many version change events.

## [v1.97.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.97.0)

Released at 2024-01-30

**v1.97.x is a line of [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/). It contains important up-to-date bugfixes for [VictoriaMetrics enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/).
All these fixes are also included in [the latest community release](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest).
The v1.97.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.97.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1970) release**

* SECURITY: upgrade base docker image (Alpine) from 3.19.0 to 3.19.1. See [alpine 3.19.1 release notes](https://www.alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.19.1-released.html).
* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.21.5 to Go1.21.6. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.21.6](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.21.6+label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* FEATURE: improve new [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#time-series) registration speed on systems with high number of CPU cores. Thanks to @misutoth for the initial idea and [implementation](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5212).
* FEATURE: make [background merge](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#storage) more responsive and scalable. This should help the following issues: [5190](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5190), [3425](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3425), [648](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/648).
* FEATURE: [graphite](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#graphite-render-api-usage): add support for negative index in `groupByNode` and `aliasByNode` functions. Thanks to @rbizos for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5581).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): add support for discovering [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) and [Hetzner Robot](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot) scrape targets. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3154) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#hetzner_sd_configs).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): add support for [DataDog v2 data ingestion protocol](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/metrics/#submit-metrics). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-send-data-from-datadog-agent) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4451).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): reduce initial memory usage when scraping targets, which return huge responses (for example, [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) in large Kubernetes cluster may return 100MB+ responses), without the need to explicitly enable [stream parsing mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#stream-parsing-mode). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5567).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): expose ability to set OAuth2 endpoint parameters per each `-remoteWrite.url` via the command-line flag `-remoteWrite.oauth2.endpointParams`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#advanced-usage). Thanks to @mhill-holoplot for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5427).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): add ability to set `attach_metadata.node=true` option for all the [`kubernetes_sd_configs`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#kubernetes_sd_configs) defined at [`-promscrape.config`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#quick-start) via `-promscrape.kubernetes.attachNodeMetadataAll` command-line flag. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4640). Thanks to @wasim-nihal for [the initial implementation](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5593).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): do not send unfinished [aggregation state](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/) on shutdown or [hot config reload](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#configuration-update) by default, as it tend to produce unexpected anomalies with lower values. The old behavior can be restored by specifying `flush_on_shutdown: true` setting in streaming aggregation config. See more details [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#aggregation-outputs).
* FEATURE: [streaming aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): expand `%{ENV_VAR}` placeholders in config files with the corresponding environment variable values.
* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): expose ability to set OAuth2 endpoint parameters via the following command-line flags:
  - `-datasource.oauth2.endpointParams` for `-datasource.url`
  - `-notifier.oauth2.endpointParams` for `-notifier.url`
  - `-remoteRead.oauth2.endpointParams` for `-remoteRead.url`
  - `-remoteWrite.oauth2.endpointParams` for `-remoteWrite.url`
* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): add ability to proxy incoming requests to different backends based on the requested host via `src_hosts` option at `url_map`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#generic-http-proxy-for-different-backends).
* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): expose `vmauth_user_request_backend_errors_total` and `vmauth_unauthorized_user_request_backend_errors_total` [metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#monitoring), which track the number of failed requests because of backend errors. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5565).
* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): add an ability to specify additional labels for [per-user metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#monitoring) via `metric_labels` section. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5565).
* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics components: break HTTP client connection if an error occurs after the server at `-httpListenAddr` already sent response status code. Previously such an error couldn't be detected at client side. Now the client will get an error about invalid chunked response. The error message is simultaneously written to the server log and in the last line of the response. This should help detecting errors when migrating data between VictoriaMetrics instances by [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5645).
* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics components: add ability to specify arbitrary HTTP headers to send with every request to `-pushmetrics.url`. See [`push metrics` docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#push-metrics).
* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics components: add `-metrics.exposeMetadata` command-line flag, which allows displaying `TYPE` and `HELP` metadata at `/metrics` page exposed at `-httpListenAddr`. This may be needed when the `/metrics` page is scraped by collector, which requires the `TYPE` and `HELP` metadata such as [Google Cloud Managed Prometheus](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/troubleshooting#missing-metric-type).
* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics components: add ability to dynamically re-read auth keys and passwords from files and urls when using `file:///path/to/file` or `http://host/path` syntax for the following command-line flags: `-configAuthKey`, `-deleteAuthKey`, `-flagsAuthKey`, `-forceMergeAuthKey`, `-forceFlushAuthKey`, `-httpAuth.password`, `-metricsAuthKey`, `-pprofAuthKey`, `-reloadAuthKey`, `-search.resetCacheAuthKey`, `-snapshotAuthKey`. For example, `-httpAuth.password=file:///path/to/password`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#security) for details.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176): add panels for detailed visualization of traffic usage between vmstorage, vminsert, vmselect components and their clients. New panels are available in the rows dedicated to specific components.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176): update "Slow Queries" panel to show percentage of the slow queries to the total number of read queries served by vmselect. The percentage value should make it more clear for users whether there is a service degradation.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/single](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10229): change dashboard title from `VictoriaMetrics` to `VictoriaMetrics - single-node`. The new title should provide better understanding of this dashboard purpose.
* FEATURE: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): rename cmd-line flag `vm-native-disable-retries` to `vm-native-disable-per-metric-migration` to better reflect its meaning.
* FEATURE: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): add `-vm-native-src-insecure-skip-verify` and `-vm-native-dst-insecure-skip-verify` command-line flags for native protocol. It can be used for skipping TLS certificate verification when connecting to the source or destination addresses.
* FEATURE: [Alerting rules for VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker#alerts): add `job` label to `DiskRunsOutOfSpace` alerting rule, so it is easier to understand to which installation the triggered instance belongs.
* FEATURE: `vmstorage`: add tenant identifier for log messages regarding dropping excessive labels due to limits defined by `-maxLabelsPerTimeseries` or `-maxLabelValueLen` command-line flags. Previously, it was hard to understand to which tenant the dropped labels belong.
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add the ability to export and import query reports:
  - add a `Query Analyzer` page that allows you to build graphs from `JSON` data containing the results of executing a query request. 
  - add an `Export query` button to the graph that saves the result of executing the query in `JSON`. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5497).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add `-vmui.defaultTimezone` flag to set a default timezone. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5375) and [these docs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/app/vmui#timezone-configuration).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): include UTC in the timezone selection dropdown for standardized time referencing. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5375).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add the ability to expand/collapse all tracing entries and download tracing data in .json format. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5677).
* FEATURE: add [VictoriaMetrics datasource](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/grafana-datasource) to docker compose environment. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5363).

* BUGFIX: properly return the list of matching label names and label values from [`/api/v1/labels`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/url-examples/#apiv1labels) and [`/api/v1/label/.../values`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/url-examples/#apiv1labelvalues) when the database contains more than `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` unique [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#time-series) on the selected time range. Previously VictoriaMetrics could return `the number of matching timeseries exceeds ...`  error in this case. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5055).
* BUGFIX: properly return errors from [export APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-export-time-series). Previously these errors were silently suppressed. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5649).
* BUGFIX: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly return full results when `-search.skipSlowReplicas` command-line flag is passed to `vmselect` and when [vmstorage groups](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/#vmstorage-groups-at-vmselect) are in use. Previously partial results could be returned in this case.
* BUGFIX: `vminsert`: properly accept samples via [OpenTelemetry data ingestion protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#sending-data-via-opentelemetry) when these samples have no [resource attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/go/resources/). Previously such samples were silently skipped.
* BUGFIX: `vmstorage`: added missing `-inmemoryDataFlushInterval` command-line flag, which was missing in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) after implementing [this feature](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3337) in [v1.85.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.85.0).
* BUGFIX: `vmstorage`: properly expire `storage/prefetchedMetricIDs` cache. Previously this cache was never expired, so it could grow big under [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/faq/#what-is-high-churn-rate). This could result in increasing CPU load over time.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): check `-external.url` schema when starting vmalert, must be `http` or `https`. Before, alertmanager could reject alert notifications if `-external.url` contained no or wrong schema.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): automatically add `exported_` prefix for original evaluation result label if it's conflicted with external or reserved one, previously it was overridden. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5161).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): autogenerate `ALERTS_FOR_STATE` time series for alerting rules with `for: 0`. Previously, `ALERTS_FOR_STATE` was generated only for alerts with `for > 0`. The change aligns with Prometheus behavior. See more details in [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5648).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): fix data race during hot-config reload. The result of the race could cause all rules from updated group to fail with `context cancelled` error.
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): consistently sort results for `q1 or q2` query, so they do not change colors with each refresh in Grafana. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5393).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly return results from [bottomk](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#bottomk) and `bottomk_*()` functions when some of these results contain NaN values. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5506). Thanks to @xiaozongyang for [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5509).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly handle queries, which wrap [rollup functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#rollup-functions) with multiple arguments without explicitly specified lookbehind window in square brackets into [aggregate functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#aggregate-functions). For example, `sum(quantile_over_time(0.5, process_resident_memory_bytes))` was resulting to `expecting at least 2 args to ...; got 1 args` error. Thanks to @atykhyy for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5414).
* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): retry on import errors in `vm-native` mode. Before, retries happened only on writes into a network connection between source and destination. But errors returned by server after all the data was transmitted were logged, but not retried.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly assume role with [AWS IRSA authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html). Previously role chaining was not supported. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3822) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): exit if there is config syntax error in [`scrape_config_files`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#loading-scrape-configs-from-multiple-files) when `-promscrape.config.strictParse=true`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5508).
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly discover targets for `role: endpoints` and `role: endpointslice` in [kubernetes_sd_configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#kubernetes_sd_configs). Previously some `endpoints` and `endpointslice` targets could be left undiscovered or some targets could have missing `__meta_*` labels when performing service discovery in busy Kubernetes clusters with large number of pods. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5557).
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): respect explicitly set `series_limit: 0` in [scrape_config](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#scrape_configs). This allows removing [`series_limit` restriction](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#cardinality-limiter) on a per-`scrape_config` basis when global limit is set via `-promscrape.seriesLimitPerTarget`. Previously, `0` value was ignored in favor of `-promscrape.seriesLimitPerTarget`.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): do not discover scrape targets for already terminated pods and containers in [`kubernetes_sd_configs`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#kubernetes_sd_configs). Such pods and containers cannot be scraped and cannot resurrect, so there is no sense in generating scrape targets for them.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly follow redirects to another hostnames when `follow_redirects: true` option is set in [`scrape_configs`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#http-api-client-options) while [stream parsing mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#stream-parsing-mode) is disabled. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1945) and [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/4931).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix a link for the statistic inaccuracy explanation in the cardinality explorer tool. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5460).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix the display of autocomplete results and cache the results. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5472) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5470).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): send `step` param for instant queries. The change reverts [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3896) due to reasons explained in [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3896#issuecomment-1896704401).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix the `Enter` key press issue in the `Query` field when using autocomplete. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5667).
* BUGFIX: all: fix potential panic during components shutdown when [metrics push](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#push-metrics) is configured. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5548). Thanks to @zhdd99 for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5549).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly process queries with too big lookbehind window such as `foo[100y]`. Previously, such queries could return empty responses even if `foo` is present in database. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5553).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly handle possible negative results caused by float operations precision error in rollup functions like rate() or increase(). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5571).
* BUGFIX: `vmselect`: vmsingle/vmselect returns http status 429 (TooManyRequests) instead of 503 (ServiceUnavailable) when max concurrent requests limit is reached.
* BUGFIX: `vmselect`: set proper timestamps in [instant query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#instant-query) results if the query contains [rollup functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#rollup-functions) with lookbehind windows in square brackets exceeding 3 hours. For example, `sum(avg_over_time(up[24h]))`. This bug has been introduced in [v1.95.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog_2023/#v1950). See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5659) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5730) issues.

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.22.2 to Go1.22.4. See the list of issues addressed in [Go1.22.3](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.22.3+label%3ACherryPickApproved) and [Go1.22.4](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.22.4+label%3ACherryPickApproved).
* SECURITY: upgrade base docker image (Alpine) from 3.19.1 to 3.20.0. See [alpine 3.20.0 release notes](https://www.alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.20.0-released.html).

* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix calendar display when `UTC+00:00` timezone is set. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6239).
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): skip empty data blocks before sending to the remote write destination. Thanks to @viperstars for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6241).
* BUGFIX: properly estimate the needed memory for query execution if it has the format [`aggr_func`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#aggregate-functions)([`rollup_func[d]`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#rollup-functions) (for example, `sum(rate(request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))`). This should allow performing aggregations over bigger number of time series when VictoriaMetrics runs in environments with small amounts of available memory. The issue has been introduced in [this commit](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/commit/5138eaeea0791caa34bcfab410e0ca9cd253cd8f) in [v1.83.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog_2022/#v1830).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): filter deleted label names and values from [`/api/v1/labels`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/url-examples/#apiv1labels) and [`/api/v1/label/.../values`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/url-examples/#apiv1labelvalues) responses when `match[]` filter matches small number of time series. The issue was introduced [v1.81.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog_2022/#v1810).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): fix misleading error logs in vmalert's stdout when unsupported HTTP path is requested.
* BUGFIX: retry files delete attempts on vXFS file system for `EEXIST` error type. See the [related issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6396). Thanks to @pludov for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6398).

## [v1.93.14](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.93.14)

Released at 2024-04-19

The v1.93.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.93.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1930) release**

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.21.7 to Go1.22.2. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.22.1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.22.1+label%3ACherryPickApproved) and [the list of issues addressed in Go1.22.2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.22.2+label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): set correct `endsAt` value in notifications sent to the Alertmanager. Previously, a rule with evaluation intervals lower than 10s could never be triggered. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5995) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): properly account for `-rule.resendDelay` for alerting rules that are constantly switching state from inactive to firing. Before, notifications for such rules could have been skipped if state change happened more often than `-rule.resendDelay`. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6028) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): respect `-remoteWrite.maxBatchSize` at shutdown period. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6025). Thanks to @jiekun for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6039).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): supported any status codes from the range 200-299 from alertmanager. Previously, only 200 status code considered a successful action. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6110).

## [v1.93.13](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.93.13)

Released at 2024-03-01

**v1.93.x is a line of [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/). It contains important up-to-date bugfixes.
The v1.93.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.93.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1930) release**

* BUGFIX: downgrade Go builder from `1.22.0` to `1.21.7`, since `1.22.0` contains [the bug](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/65705), which can lead to deadlocked HTTP connections to remote storage systems, scrape targets and service discovery endpoints at [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/). This may result in incorrect service discovery, target scraping and failed sending samples to remote storage.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): accept OpenTelemetry data at `/opentelemetry/v1/metrics`, since the `/v1/metrics` suffix is hardcoded at [OpenTelemetry protocol specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp-request).
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): fix possible deadlock when [sharding among remote storages](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#sharding-among-remote-storages) is enabled with `-remoteWrite.shardByURL` command-line flag. Thanks to @penguinlav for [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5834) for [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5833).

* BUGFIX: fix the misleading error `0ms is out of allowed range [0 ...` when passing `step=0` to [/api/v1/query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#instant-query)
  or [/api/v1/query_range](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#range-query). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5795).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): fixed floating-point error when parsing time in RFC3339 format. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5801) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmalert): consistently sort groups by name and filename on `/groups` page in UI. This should prevent non-deterministic sorting for groups with identical names.
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly construct the destination label in [label_join](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#label_join) if it is used as source label. See this [issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5881) for details.

## [v1.93.12](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.93.12)

Released at 2024-02-14

**v1.93.x is a line of [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/). It contains important up-to-date bugfixes.
The v1.93.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.93.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1930) release**

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.21.6 to Go1.22.0. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.21.7](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.21.7+label%3ACherryPickApproved), plus [the changelog for Go1.22.0](https://go.dev/doc/go1.22).

* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly propagate [label filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#filtering) from multiple arguments passed to [aggregate functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#aggregate-functions). For example, `sum({job="foo"}, {job="bar"}) by (job) + a` was improperly optimized to `sum({job="foo"}, {job="bar"}) by (job) + a{job="foo"}` before being executed. This could lead to unexpected results. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5604).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly handle precision errors when calculating [changes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#changes), [changes_prometheus](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#changes_prometheus), [increases_over_time](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#increases_over_time) and [resets](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#resets) functions. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/767).
* BUGFIX: properly store [staleness markers](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#prometheus-staleness-markers) for [self-scraped metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#monitoring) on single-node VictoriaMetrics shutdown. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/943).
* BUGFIX: prevent from possible `too big indexBlockSize` panic when samples with too long label values (~64Kb) are ingested into VictoriaMetrics.

* BUGFIX: properly return errors from [export APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-export-time-series). Previously these errors were silently suppressed. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5649).
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly discover targets for `role: endpoints` and `role: endpointslice` in [kubernetes_sd_configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#kubernetes_sd_configs). Previously some `endpoints` and `endpointslice` targets could be left undiscovered or some targets could have missing `__meta_*` labels when performing service discovery in busy Kubernetes clusters with large number of pods. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5557).
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): respect explicitly set `series_limit: 0` in [scrape_config](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#scrape_configs). This allows removing [`series_limit` restriction](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#cardinality-limiter) on a per-`scrape_config` basis when global limit is set via `-promscrape.seriesLimitPerTarget`. Previously, `0` value was ignored in favor of `-promscrape.seriesLimitPerTarget`.
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly process queries with too big lookbehind window such as `foo[100y]`. Previously, such queries could return empty responses even if `foo` is present in database. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5553).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly handle possible negative results caused by float operations precision error in rollup functions like rate() or increase(). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5571).

## [v1.93.10](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.93.10)

Released at 2024-01-17

**v1.93.x is a line of [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/). It contains important up-to-date bugfixes.
The v1.93.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.93.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1930) release**

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.21.5 to Go1.21.6. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.21.6](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.21.6+label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* BUGFIX: `vminsert`: properly accept samples via [OpenTelemetry data ingestion protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#sending-data-via-opentelemetry) when these samples have no [resource attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/go/resources/). Previously such samples were silently skipped.
* BUGFIX: `vmstorage`: added missing `-inmemoryDataFlushInterval` command-line flag, which was missing in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) after implementing [this feature](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3337) in [v1.85.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.85.0).
* BUGFIX: `vmstorage`: properly expire `storage/prefetchedMetricIDs` cache. Previously this cache was never expired, so it could grow big under [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/faq/#what-is-high-churn-rate). This could result in increasing CPU load over time.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): check `-external.url` schema when starting vmalert, must be `http` or `https`. Before, alertmanager could reject alert notifications if `-external.url` contained no or wrong schema.
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly return results from [bottomk](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#bottomk) and `bottomk_*()` functions when some of these results contain NaN values. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5506). Thanks to @xiaozongyang for [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5509).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly handle queries, which wrap [rollup functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#rollup-functions) with multiple arguments without explicitly specified lookbehind window in square brackets into [aggregate functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#aggregate-functions). For example, `sum(quantile_over_time(0.5, process_resident_memory_bytes))` was resulting to `expecting at least 2 args to ...; got 1 args` error. Thanks to @atykhyy for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5414).
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly assume role with [AWS IRSA authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html). Previously role chaining was not supported. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3822) for details.
* BUGFIX: all: fix potential panic during components shutdown when [metrics push](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#push-metrics) is configured. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5548). Thanks to @zhdd99 for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5549).
* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): check for Error field in response from influx client during migration. Before, only network errors were checked. Thanks to @wozz for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5446).
* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): retry on import errors in `vm-native` mode. Before, retries happened only on writes into a network connection between source and destination. But errors returned by server after all the data was transmitted were logged, but not retried.

## [v1.87.14](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.87.14)

Released at 2024-02-01

**v1.87.x is a line of [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/). It contains important up-to-date bugfixes.
The v1.87.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.87.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1870) release**

* SECURITY: upgrade base docker image (Alpine) from 3.19.0 to 3.19.1. See [alpine 3.19.1 release notes](https://www.alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.19.1-released.html).

* BUGFIX: properly return errors from [export APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-export-time-series). Previously these errors were silently suppressed. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5649).
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): respect explicitly set `series_limit: 0` in [scrape_config](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#scrape_configs). This allows removing [`series_limit` restriction](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#cardinality-limiter) on a per-`scrape_config` basis when global limit is set via `-promscrape.seriesLimitPerTarget`. Previously, `0` value was ignored in favor of `-promscrape.seriesLimitPerTarget`.
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly process queries with too big lookbehind window such as `foo[100y]`. Previously, such queries could return empty responses even if `foo` is present in database. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5553).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly handle possible negative results caused by float operations precision error in rollup functions like rate() or increase(). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5571).

## [v1.87.13](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.87.13)

Released at 2024-01-17

**v1.87.x is a line of [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/). It contains important up-to-date bugfixes.
The v1.87.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.87.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1870) release**

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.21.5 to Go1.21.6. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.21.6](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.21.6+label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* BUGFIX: `vmstorage`: added missing `-inmemoryDataFlushInterval` command-line flag, which was missing in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) after implementing [this feature](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3337) in [v1.85.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.85.0).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly handle queries, which wrap [rollup functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#rollup-functions) with multiple arguments without explicitly specified lookbehind window in square brackets into [aggregate functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#aggregate-functions). For example, `sum(quantile_over_time(0.5, process_resident_memory_bytes))` was resulting to `expecting at least 2 args to ...; got 1 args` error. Thanks to @atykhyy for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5414).
* BUGFIX: `vmstorage`: properly expire `storage/prefetchedMetricIDs` cache. Previously this cache was never expired, so it could grow big under [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/faq/#what-is-high-churn-rate). This could result in increasing CPU load over time.
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): properly return results from [bottomk](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#bottomk) and `bottomk_...` functions when some of these results contain NaN values. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5506). Thanks to @xiaozongyang for [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5509).
* BUGFIX: all: fix potential panic during components shutdown when [metrics push](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#push-metrics) is configured. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5548). Thanks to @zhdd99 for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5549).
