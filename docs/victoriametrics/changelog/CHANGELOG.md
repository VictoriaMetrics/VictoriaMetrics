## [v1.125.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.125.0)

Released at 2025-08-29

**Known issues: this release has a bug in vmui's [Cardinality Explorer](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#cardinality-explorer) page that makes some UI elements unresponsive. The issue was addressed in [v1.125.1](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/changelog/#v11251) release.**

* FEATURE: upgrade Go builder from Go1.24.6 to Go1.25. See [Go1.25 release notes](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.25).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): replace `Alerts` tab with `Alerting` tab in vmui. The new `Alerting` tab displays vmalert groups and rules directly in vmui interface without redirecting user to vmalert's WEB UI. Links of format `.*/prometheus/vmalert/.*` will continue working by redirecting to vmalert's UI. This functionality is available only if `-vmalert.proxyURL` is set on vmselect. Some functionality of the new `Alerting` tab requires vmalert to be of the same version as vmselect, or higher.
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): add export functionality for Query (Table view) and RawQuery tabs in CSV/JSON format. See [#9332](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9332).
* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): add `/api/v1/group?group_id=<id>` API endpoint for viewing details of a specific [rules group](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#groups). The new handler is used by new `Alerting` tab in vmselect.
* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): add `lastError` field to `/api/v1/notifiers` response. The new field contains an error message if the last attempt to send data to the notifier failed. The error can be also viewed in `Alerting. Notifiers` tab.
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/) in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): apply `-search.maxQueryLen` limit to Graphite queries. Previously, this limit was only applied to Prometheus queries.
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): optimize `/api/v1/labels` and `/api/v1/label/TAG/values` requests with a single `match` or `extra_filters` filter containing timeseries metric name. See this PR [#9489](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/9489) for details.

* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): prevent remote write ingestion stop on push error for [Google Pub/Sub](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/pubsub/#writing-metrics) integration.
* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/): properly handle [mTLS authorization and routing](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#mtls-based-request-routing). Previously it didn't work. See [#29](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/issues/29).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/metricsql/): fix `timestamp` function compatibility with Prometheus when used with sub-expressions such as `timestamp(sum(foo))`. The fix applies only when `-search.disableImplicitConversion` flag is set. See more in [#9527-comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9527#issuecomment-3200646020) and [metricsql#55](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/metricsql/pull/55).
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): optimize subtract operation on uint64 sets. This should potentially improve index search with huge number of deleted series. See this issue [9602](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9602) for details.
* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) components: fix support for automatic issuing of TLS certificates for HTTPS server at `-httpListenAddr` via [Let's Encrypt service](https://letsencrypt.org/). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#automatic-issuing-of-tls-certificates).

## [v1.124.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.124.0)

Released at 2025-08-15

**Known issues: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): performance regression for queries that match [previously deleted time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#how-to-delete-time-series). The issue affects installation that previously deleted big number of time series (can be checked via `vm_deleted_metrics_total` metric) but continue querying them. More details in [#9602](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9602). The degradation is addressed in [v1.125.1](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/changelog/#v11251) release.**

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.24.5 to Go1.24.6. See [the list of issues addressed in Go1.24.6](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.24.6+label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/) in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): protect graphite `/render` API endpoint with new flag `-search.maxGraphitePathExpressionLen`. See this PR [#9534](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/9534) for details.
* FEATURE: expose `vm_total_disk_space_bytes` metric at the [`/metrics` page](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#monitoring), which shows the total disk space for the data directory specified via [`-storageDataPath`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#storage). This metric can be useful for building alerts and graphs for the percentage of free disk space via `vm_free_disk_space_bytes / vm_total_disk_space_bytes`. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/9523#issuecomment-3149459926).
* FEATURE: all: leave non-existing environment variables as is in config files instead of failure. For example, if the file referred by `-promscrape.config` contains `%{NON_EXISTING_ENV_VAR}` placeholder, then it is left as is instead of failing to load the file. This simplifies the usage of environment variables in config files and in command-line flags according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#environment-variables). Users can easily notice non-existing env vars in config files and in command-line flags by looking at their values - they will literally contain `%{NON_EXISTING_ENV_VAR}` strings.
* FEATURE: `vmselect`, `vminsert` and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): add rpc handshake timeout configuration via `-rpc.handshakeTimeout` flag (default 5s). Set deadline for the entire handshake process instead of per-operation timeout. See [#9345](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9345) for more details.
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): add `-enableMetadata` command-line flag to allow sending metadata to the configured `-remoteWrite.url`, metadata can be scraped from targets, received via VictoriaMetrics remote write, Prometheus remote write v1 or OpenTelemetry protocol. See [#2974](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2974).

* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): treat single `remoteWrite.disableOnDiskQueue` flag the same way as if it is explicitly specified for each remote write url. See [#9565](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9565) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/): properly read proxy-protocol header. See this PR [#9546](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/9546) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/) in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): prevent resource leak on partial responses for `/federate` API requests. This this PR [9536](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/9536) for details. Thanks to the @fxrlv.
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): prevent performance degradation on hitting daily or hourly series cardinality limits. See this issue [9554](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9554) for details.
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/metricsql/): gracefully handle `histogram_quantile` calculation for histograms where buckets are created on demand. This change isn't needed for users who use native instrumentation SDKs for metrics from [VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/metrics), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/) or [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/metricsql/): return a proper error message when the function argument is expected to be a string or scalar.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): fix potential data race and missing firing states when replaying alerting rule with `-replay.ruleEvaluationConcurrency>1`.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): fix the `{{ $activeAt }}` variable value in annotation templating when the alert has already triggered. See this issue [#9543](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9543) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert-tool](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert-tool/): print a proper error message when templating function fails during execution. Previously, vmalert-tool could throw a misleading panic message instead.
* BUGFIX: [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackup/), [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackupmanager/): allow enabling checksum calculation for PUT requests by using `-s3ChecksumAlgorithm` command-line flag. This is required for S3 configurations with WORM being enabled. See [#9532](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9532).
* BUGFIX: [dashboards/vmagent](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12683): fix samples rate panel not showing data in case vmagent is not scraping metrics. Previously, the panel would not display "samples in" results if vmagent only accepts metrics via push protocols.
* BUGFIX: [dashboards/victoriametrics-cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176): fix panels showing 99th percentile of series or samples read per query or per series. Before, panels were showing the summarized value across all vmselect instances, which didn't make much sense. Now, panels show the max value across the vmselect instances, making it easier to understand complexity of the heaviest queries served.

## [v1.123.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.123.0)

Released at 2025-08-01

* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): introduce `-storage.idbPrefillStart` flag (default: 1h) to control how early next indexdb prefill starts before rotation. Increasing the value may reduce CPU spikes during rotation. See [#9393-comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9393#issuecomment-3083841658) for details.
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): Add support for dynamically enabling new series logging via the `/internal/log_new_series` API and corresponding authFlag `-logNewSeriesAuthKey`. The logging is enabled for one minute and is automatically disabled afterward. This is a more convenient alternative to the `-logNewSeries` flag. See [8879](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8879) for details. Thanks to the @leiwingqueen

## [v1.122.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.122.0)

Released at 2025-07-18

**Update Note 1:** [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): The `-snapshotsMaxAge` flag default have been changed to `3d`. This enables automatic deletion of snapshots older than 3 days. If you want to keep the previous behavior (never automatically deleting snapshots), please set `-snapshotsMaxAge=0`. See [#9344](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9344) for the details.

**Update Note 2:** all the [VictoriaMetrics Enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) components: `-eula` command-line flag is skipped when validating VictoriaMetrics enterprise license. Instead, the `-license` or `-licenseFile` command-line flags must be used to provide a valid license key. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) for configuration examples.

See [#8969](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8969).
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly apply `retentionFilter` on flag value changes.

Now it ignores corrupted `metric_usage_tracker` file content and init tracker with empty state in the same way as other caches loaded. See [9074](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9074) issue for details.
* BUGFIX: `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): fix inconsistent behaviour of tenants cache when using [multi-tenant reads](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#multitenancy-via-labels). Previously, `vmselect` could use cached list of tenants which covered only part of the requested time range. That would lead to incomplete query results. See [#9042](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9042).
* BUGFIX: `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): remove tenant labels `vm_account_id` and `vm_project_id` from [exported data](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#how-to-export-time-series) if tenant info was [specified in URL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#url-format). These labels will be present only if export is done via [/multitenant/ endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#multitenancy-via-labels), as such response could contain series belonging to different tenants. This change also fixes inconsistency in vmctl's [cluster-to-cluster migration mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmctl/#cluster-to-cluster-migration-mode)  - see [#9016](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9016) for details.

* BUGFIX: [alerts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/deployment/docker/rules): fix the alerting rule `ScrapePoolHasNoTargets`. Previously, it may cause false positive in [sharding mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/#scraping-big-number-of-targets).
* BUGFIX: [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/) in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): include full list of query filters to build a cache key for [multitenant read](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#multitenancy-via-labels) queries. Previously, cache key did not include tenancy related labels so cache entries could be shared between tenants breaking tenant isolation.

## [v1.116.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.116.0)

Released at 2025-04-25

**Update Note 1:** Updated the RPC cluster protocol version for the [TSDB status API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#tsdb-stats), so calls to `/api/v1/status/tsdb` may temporarily fail until vmstorage and vmselect are updated to the same version. 

**Update note 2:** [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/)'s data distribution algorithm of remote write is changed from round-robin to consistent hashing when `-remoteWrite.shardByURL` is enabled. This means vmagents with `-remoteWrite.shardByURL` will re-shard series after the upgrade, which may result into temporary higher churn rate and memory usage on remote destinations. See [#8546](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8546) for details.

* FEATURE: all the VictoriaMetrics components: mask `authKey` value from log messages. See [#5973](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5973) for details.
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): add `Requests count` and `Last request` columns to Cardinality Explorer to [show metric usage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#track-ingested-metrics-usage). See [#6145](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6145).
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): add command-line flag `-search.logSlowQueryStats`. This flag is available only in VictoriaMetrics [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/). See [Query Stats](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/query-stats/) for details.
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): use consistent hashing for data distribution for remote write when `remoteWrite.shardByURL` is enabled. It helps to minimize re-sharding when removing or adding new remote write destinations. See [#8546](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8546) for details.
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): dynamically upgrade to [VM remote write protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/#victoriametrics-remote-write-protocol) or downgrade to Prometheus protocol in runtime. This solves the problem of choosing the wrong protocol if remote destination was unavailable on vmagent start. See [#8462](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8462) for details.
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): reduce log noise from remote write retries by throttling warning messages to one per 5 seconds. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8723) for details.
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): enhance  `/api/v1/status/metric_names_stats` with `match_pattern` regex support. See [#6145](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6145) for details and how to [Track ingested metrics usage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#track-ingested-metrics-usage).
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/)  and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): add stats for metric name usage to TSDB Status API response. See [#6145](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6145) for details and [TSDB stats](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#tsdb-stats) docs.
* FEATURE: [vmui relabeling playground](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#relabeling): enforce strict validation for `Labels` text area: it now accepts only labels enclosed in curly braces `{__name__="name", label="value"}`. See [#8584](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8584).
* FEATURE: [dashboards/per-tenant-statistic](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/dashboards/clusterbytenant.json): add panel for showing churn rate generated by each tenant on short time-window. The panel should make temporary spikes in churn more visible.
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/), [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): add helpful hints to the unexpected EOF error message in the write concurrency limiter. See [#8704](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8704) for details.
* FEATURE: `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): log client network errors (EOFs, timeouts) during handshake as warnings, since they are not actionable from server point of view.

* BUGFIX: all the VictoriaMetrics components: properly detect `cgroupv2` [CPU limits](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#cpu). See [#8808](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8808) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): properly init [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) version for `linux/arm` and non-CGO builds. See [#6019](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6019) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): remote write client sets correct content encoding header based on actual body content, rather than relying on configuration. See [#8650](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8650).
* BUGFIX: [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackup/) and [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackupmanager/): properly configure s3 client with if `configFilePath` is set. See [#8668](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8668) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackup/), [vmrestore](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmrestore/), [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackupmanager/): enable support of HTTP/2 for connections to S3-compatible storage endpoints. It was disabled in [v1.115.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.115.0) and could lead to connection errors with some S3-compatible storage providers.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): correctly update the `debug` param for recording rule when updating the rule group.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): properly set the rule group id in `/rules` and `/alerts` APIs. Previously, the group id was not set, preventing rules from being toggled by group in the vmalert UI. See [#8773](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8773).
* BUGFIX: [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/) in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): fix [metric query stats API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#track-ingested-metrics-usage) to correctly handle metric names longer than 256 bytes, respecting the `-maxLabelValueLen` flag. See [#8759](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8759) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): support `identity` value in `Content-Encoding` HTTP header.

See [#8649](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8649).
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/), [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/), `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): restore write concurrency limiter for data ingestion. The limiter was unintentionally removed in [v1.115.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.115.0) and potentially could lead to increased memory usage in certain scenarios. See [#8742](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8742).
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vmstorage` and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): allow using `-downsampling.period=filter:0s:0s` to skip downsampling for time series that match the specified `filter`. See [Downsampling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#downsampling).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): fix duplicated series in the legend on the Raw Query page when deduplication is disabled. See [#8688](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8688).

## [v1.113.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.113.0)

Released at 2025-03-07

**Known issues: this release contains change that could increase CPU usage for vminsert, vmagent, vmsingle for certain type of workloads. See [#8501](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8501) for details. 
If you are impacted by this, please upgrade to [v1.114.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.114.0) or rollback to [v1.111.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.111.0).**

**Update note 1: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/) include a fix which enforces IPv6 addresses escaping for containers discovered with [Kubernetes service-discovery](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/sd_configs/#kubernetes_sd_configs) and `role: pod` which do not have exposed ports defined. This means that `address` for these containers will always be wrapped in square brackets, this might affect some relabeling rules which were relying on previous behaviour.**

**Update note 2: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/) disallows using [time buckets stats pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-by-time-buckets) in alerting or recording rules with VictoriaLogs as datasource. Time buckets used with [stats query API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats) may produce unexpected results for user and result into cardinality issues.**

**Update note 3: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/) disallows specifying `eval_offset` and `eval_delay` options in the same [group](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#groups). The `eval_offset` option ensures the group is evaluated at the exact offset in the range of [0...interval]. However, with `eval_delay`, this behavior cannot be guaranteed without further adjusting the evaluation time, which could lead to more confusion.**

* FEATURE: upgrade Go builder from Go1.23.6 to Go1.24. See [Go1.24 release notes](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.24).
* FEATURE: provide alternative registry for all VictoriaMetrics components at [Quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/victoriametrics).
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): add a new flag `--storage.trackMetricNamesStats` and a new HTTP API - `/api/v1/status/metric_names_stats`. It allows to track how frequent ingested [metric names](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#structure-of-a-metric) are used during [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#query-data). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4458) for details and related [docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#track-ingested-metrics-usage)
* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): make `KeyValueList`, `ArrayValue` [OpenTelemetry protocol for metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#sending-data-via-opentelemetry) attributes label values compatible with open-telemetry-collector format. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8384).
* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): disallow using [time buckets stats pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-by-time-buckets) in VictoriaLogs rule expressions. Such construction produces meaningless results for [stats query API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats) and may lead to cardinality issues.
* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): remove random sleep before a group starts when `eval_offset` is specified, because `eval_offset` already disperses the group evaluation time, serving the same purpose as the random sleep. This change also enables chaining groups, see [this doc](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#chaining-groups) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/860).
* FEATURE: [vmalert-tool](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert-tool/): add command-line flag `-httpListenPort` to specify the port used during testing. If not provided, a random unoccupied port will be assigned. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8393).
* FEATURE: [vmalert-tool](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert-tool/): make the temporary storage path for unittest unique, allowing user to run multiple vmalert-tool processes on a single host simultaneously. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8393).
* FEATURE: [alerts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/deployment/docker/rules/alerts-vmalert.yml): add alerting rule `TooHighQueryLoad` to notify user when VictoriaMetrics or vmselect weren't able to serve requests in timely manner during last 15min.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/single](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10229) and [dashboards/cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176): add panel `Deduplication rate` that shows how many samples are [deduplicated](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#deduplication) during merges or read queries by VictoriaMetrics components.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/single](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10229) and [dashboards/cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176): add panel `Number of snapshots` that shows the max number of [snapshots](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#how-to-work-with-snapshots) across vmstorage nodes. This panel should help in disk usage [troubleshooting](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#snapshot-troubleshooting).
* FEATURE: [dashboards/single](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10229) and [dashboards/cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176): account for samples dropped according to [relabeling config](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#relabeling) in `Samples dropped for last 1h` panel.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/single](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10229) and [dashboards/cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176): show number of parts in the last partition on `LSM parts max by type` panel. Before, the resulting graph could be skewed by the max number of parts across all partitions. Displaying parts for the latest partition is the correct way to show if storage is currently impacted by merge delays.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176): add panel `Partial query results` that shows the number of served [partial responses](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#cluster-availability) by vmselects.

* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): fix the incorrect caching of extMetricsIDs when a query timeout error occurs. This can lead to incorrect query results. Thanks to @changshun-shi for [the bug report issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8345).
* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmctl/): respect time filter when exploring time series for [influxdb mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmctl/influxdb/). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8259) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/): properly apply global relabeling configuration, defined with  `-relabelConfig` flag, for metrics scraped with `-promscrape.config`. Bug was introduces in [v1.108.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.108.0). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8389).
* BUGFIX: [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackupmanager/): properly propagate an error message when applying retention policy fails. Previously, an actual error message was discarded.
* BUGFIX: [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmgateway/): fix data query in [rate limiter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmgateway/#rate-limiter). The bug was introduced in [this commit](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/commit/68bad22fd26d1436ad0236b1f3ced8604c5d851c) starting from [v1.106.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.106.0).
* BUGFIX: [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmgateway/): properly apply the [rate limiter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmgateway/#rate-limiter) for the `rows_inserted` limit type. Previously, the rate limit for this type was ignored.
* BUGFIX: [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmgateway/): properly handle HTTP requests with path ending with a trailing `/` when using the [rate limiter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmgateway/#rate-limiter). Previously, the trailing slash was removed and caused an incorrect redirect path when visiting VMUI. Thanks to @jindov for [the bug report issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8439).
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): properly escape IPv6 address in [Kubernetes service-discovery](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/sd_configs/#kubernetes_sd_configs) with `role: pod` for containers without exposed ports. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8374).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert-tool](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert-tool/): clean up the temporary storage path when process is terminated by SIGTERM or SIGINT. Previously, unclean shut down might affect the next run.
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): fix an infinite loader on the [Downsampling filters debug page](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui) when provided configuration matches no series. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8339).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/metricsql/): fix filters pushdown logic for expression like `foo{a="a"} ifnot bar{a="b"}`. Previously, filters from right operand were incorrectly propagated to the left operand and could result in empty query results even if `foo{a="a"}` matches time series. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8435).
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): prevent possible panic for `foo @ bar` expression when first sample in `bar` starts with `NaN` or starts long after first sample in `foo`. Now, VM will try to find first non-NaN value in `bar` and could yield an error `@ modifier must return a non-NaN value` if it won't find it. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8444).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): prevent panic when using with rules that have zero interval: `-downsampling.period=5m:5m,0s:0s`. Such rule configuration shouldn't be rejected and cause an error when used. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8454).

If you are impacted by this, please upgrade to [v1.114.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.114.0) or rollback to [v1.111.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.111.0).**

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.23.5 to Go1.23.6. See the list of issues addressed in [Go1.23.6](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.23.6+label%3ACherryPickApproved).
* SECURITY: upgrade base docker image (Alpine) from 3.21.2 to 3.21.3. See [Alpine 3.21.3 release notes](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.18.12-3.19.7-3.20.6-3.21.3-released.html).

* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): allow [disabling per-day indexes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#index-tuning-for-low-churn-rate) for workloads with low or zero churn rates via `-disablePerDayIndex` cmd-line flag. This option works the best for IoT cases and significantly loads resource and disk usage. See [this PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6976).
* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): add command-line flag `-notifier.sendTimeout(default 10s)` to allow configuring request timeout when sending alerts to the corresponding `-notifier.url`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8287) for details. Thanks to @gjkim42 for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8297).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/) and [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/): add support of [aggregation windows](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/stream-aggregation/#aggregation-windows) to improve accuracy of stream aggregation. This feature is especially important for aggregation of [histograms](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#histogram), but enabling this feature requires additional memory. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4580).
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): add `-influx.forceStreamMode` cmd-line flag to force stream processing for data ingested via [InfluxDB protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/influxdb/#influxdb-compatible-agents-such-as-telegraf). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8269).
* FEATURE: [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): support overriding vmstorage `-maxUniqueTimeseries` with specific resource limits: `-search.maxLabelsAPISeries`, `-search. maxSeries`, `-search.maxTSDBStatusSeries` and `-search.maxDeleteSeries`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7857).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): add legend customization options - table view, hiding common values, grouping by label, and custom label format. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8031) and [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8263).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): look back for recent data for longer time intervals when switching to Table or JSON view. The look back window depends on the `step` setting, which is now set as `end - start` (30m) by default. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8240).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): preserve user-defined `step` setting when changing the time interval of displayed query. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8240#issuecomment-2647674065).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): improve numbers formatting for better readability on the `Explore Cardinality` page. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8318).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): print full error messages for failed queries on the `Explore Cardinality` page. Before, only response status code was printed. 
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): move values representing changes relative to the previous day to a separate column for easier sorting on the `Explore Cardinality` page.
* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/metricsql/): parse `$__interval` and `$__rate_interval` inside square brackets as missing square brackets. For example, `rate(m[$__interval])` is parsed as `rate(m)` instead of `rate(m[1i])`. This enables automatic detection of the lookbehind window for [rollup functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/metricsql/#rollup-functions) by VictoriaMetrics, which usually returns the most expected result.
* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/metricsql/): support auto-format (prettify) for expressions that use quoted metric or label names. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7703) for details.

* BUGFIX: all the VictoriaMetrics components: properly override basic authorization for API endpoints protected with `authKey`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7345#issuecomment-2662595807) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): fix polluted alert messages when multiple Alertmanager instances are configured with `alert_relabel_configs`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8040), and thanks to @evkuzin for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8258).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): fix the auto-generated metrics for alerts and groups. Previously, metrics might be missing after reload. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8229) for the details.
* BUGFIX: `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly return parsing errors during data ingestion in [multi-level cluster setup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#multi-level-cluster-setup). Before, some of the errors could have been silently ignored.
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/),  `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): fix negative rate result when the lookbehind window is longer than `-search.maxLookback` or `-search.maxStalenessInterval` and data contains gap. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8342).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly enforce presence of default `-retentionPeriod` configuration for [retention filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#retention-filters) debug interface. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8343).

## [v1.111.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.111.0)

Released at 2025-02-10

**Update note 1: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/) stop exposing `vm_index_search_duration_seconds` histogram metric. This metric records time spent on search operations in the index. It was introduced in [v1.56.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.56.0). However, this metric was used neither in dashboards nor in alerting rules. It also has high cardinality because index search operations latency can differ by 3 orders of magnitude. Hence, dropping it as unused.**

* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): improve startup times when opening a storage with the [retention](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#retention) exceeding a few months.
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): add the ability to switch the heatmap to a line chart. Now, vmui would suggest to switch to line graph display if heatmap can't be properly rendered. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8057).
* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/): add `-httpInternalListenAddr` cmd-line flag to serve internal HTTP routes `/metrics`, `/flags`, etc. It allows properly route requests to backends with the same service routes as vmauth. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6468) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7345) for details.
* FEATURE: expose `/-/healthy` and `/-/ready` endpoints as Prometheus does on vmselect endpoints, thus achieving full Prometheus compatibility for external dependencies.

* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): properly perform graceful shutdown for kafka client.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): properly add message metadata headers for kafka remoteWrite target.
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): improve clipboard error handling in tables and code snippets by showing detailed messages with possible reasons. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7778).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui) for [VictoriaMetrics Enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) components: properly display enterprise features when the enterprise version is used.
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): fix discrepancies when using `or` binary operator. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7759) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7640) issues for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly update number of unique series for [cardinality limiter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#cardinality-limiter) on ingestion. Previously, limit could undercount the real number of the ingested unique series.

* BUGFIX: [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackup/), [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackupmanager/): fix server-side copying of objects for Azure Blob Storage when using managed identity for authentication. Previously, it wasn't possible to use [smart backups](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackup/#smart-backups) strategy for `vmbackup` as server-side copy would fail. See [#9131](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9131).
* BUGFIX: [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackupmanager/): increase startup healthcheck delay for storage reachability from 30 seconds to 3 minutes. This is required to avoid vmbackupmanager restarts when storage node startup take more than 30 seconds (e.g. when storage nodes stores more than 5Tb of data).

## [v1.110.11](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.110.11)

All these fixes are also included in [the latest community release](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest).
The v1.110.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.110.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v11100) release**

* BUGFIX: `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): remove tenant labels `vm_account_id` and `vm_project_id` from [exported data](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#how-to-export-time-series) if tenant info was [specified in URL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#url-format). These labels will be present only if export is done via [/multitenant/ endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#multitenancy-via-labels), as such response could contain series belonging to different tenants. This change also fixes inconsistency in vmctl's [cluster-to-cluster migration mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmctl/#cluster-to-cluster-migration-mode)  - see [#9016](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9016) for details.

* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): prevent possible panic for `foo @ bar` expression when first sample in `bar` starts with `NaN` or starts long after first sample in `foo`. Now, VM will try to find first non-NaN value in `bar` and could yield an error `@ modifier must return a non-NaN value` if it won't find it. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8444).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): prevent panic when using with rules that have zero interval: `-downsampling.period=5m:5m,0s:0s`.

## [v1.109.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.109.0)

Released at 2025-01-14

**Update note: This release contains [issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8045) that might affect correctness of increase, increase_pure and delta functions. It affects only vmselect or VictoriaMetrics single-node on query time. Please, rollback vmselects to the closest previous version or update to [v1.109.1](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/changelog/#v11091).**

* FEATURE: all the VictoriaMetrics components: increase the default value for [`GOGC`](https://tip.golang.org/doc/gc-guide#GOGC) from `30` to `100`. This should reduce CPU usage at the cost of slightly higher memory usage. [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/), [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#architecture-overview) components continue using `GOGC=30`, since they are optimized for low memory allocations and low memory usage, so they do not benefit from the increased GOGC value too much. It is possible to override the default `GOGC` value in any VictoriaMetrics component by setting `GOGC` environment variable to the desired value. For example, `GOGC=200 ./path/to/vmagent` starts `vmagent` with `GOGC=200`. See [these docs](https://tip.golang.org/doc/gc-guide#GOGC) about `GOGC` tuning. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7902).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): add export data functionality for the `Raw Query` page and the ability to import exported data into the `Query Analyzer` page. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7628).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): add `markdown` support for comments during data export. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7828).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/) and [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/): added `min` and `max` metrics for Datadog Sketches API metrics, changed `_` metric name separator to `.` if metrics are not sanitized for consistency.
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/) and [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/): add service discovery support for Marathon. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/sd_configs/#marathon_sd_configs) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6642).
* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/): support `-maxIngestionRate` cmd-line flag to ratelimit samples/sec ingested. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7377) for details.
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): improve query performance on systems with high number of CPU cores. See [this PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7416) for details.
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): add command-line flag `-search.maxBinaryOpPushdownLabelValues` to allow using labels with more candidate values as push down filter in binary operation. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7243). Thanks to @tydhot for implementation.
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): add command-line flag `storage.finalDedupScheduleCheckInterval` to control the final deduplication process interval. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7880) for details.
* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): add a separate cache type for storing sparse entries when performing large index scans. This significantly reduces memory usage when applying [downsampling filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#downsampling) and [retention filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#retention-filters) during background merge. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7182) for the details.

* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): fix the auto-generated metrics `ALERTS` and `ALERTS_FOR_STATE` for alerting rules. Previously, metrics might have incorrect labels and affect the restore process. See this [issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7796).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/): do not append tenant info to VictoriaLogs datasource request path in [clusterMode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#multitenancy). See [this doc](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/#how-to-use-multitenancy-in-rules) for how to use multitenancy in VictoriaLogs.
* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/): properly set `host` field at debug information formatted with `dump_request_on_errors: true` setting.
* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/): properly handle discovery for ipv6 addresses. Thanks to @badie for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7955).
* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmctl/): fix support for migrating influx series without any tag. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7921). Thanks to @bitbidu for reporting.
* BUGFIX: `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): storage nodes defined in `-storageNode` are now sorted, ensuring that varying node orders across different vminsert instances do not result in inconsistent replication.
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly ingest `influx` line protocol metrics with empty tags. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7933) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): allow to override the default unique time series limit in vmstorage with command-line flags like `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries`, `-search.maxLabelsAPISeries`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7852).
* BUGFIX: [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly set tenancy information when evaluating numbers in a query. Previously, the tenancy information could lead to mismatch between query result and a number. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7987) for the details.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): fix marshaling of request body for Alertmanager notification. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7985) for the details.
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): don't take into account the last raw sample before the lookbehind window is sample exceeds the staleness interval. This affects correctness of increase, increase_pure, delta functions when performing calculations on time series with gaps.

Previously, it wasn't possible to use [smart backups](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackup/#smart-backups) strategy for `vmbackup` as server-side copy would fail. See [#9131](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9131).
* BUGFIX: [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackupmanager/): increase startup healthcheck delay for storage reachability from 30 seconds to 3 minutes. This is required to avoid vmbackupmanager restarts when storage node startup take more than 30 seconds (e.g. when storage nodes stores more than 5Tb of data).

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.23.4 to Go1.23.5. See the list of issues addressed in [Go1.23.5](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.23.5+label%3ACherryPickApproved).

* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/): fix possible runtime panic during requests processing under heavy load. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8051) for details.
* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) components: properly trim whitespaces at the end of license provided via `-license` and `-licenseFile` command-line flags. Previously, the trailing whitespaces could cause the license verification to fail.
* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) components: remove unnecessary delay before failing if all online verification attempts have failed. This should reduce the time required for the component to proceed if all online verification attempts have failed.
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): don't take into account the last raw sample before the lookbehind window is sample exceeds the staleness interval. This affects correctness of increase, increase_pure, delta functions when performing calculations on time series with gaps. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8002) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/): allow ingesting histograms with missing `_sum` metric via [OpenTelemetry ingestion protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#sending-data-via-opentelemetry) in the same way as Prometheus does.

* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) components: add support of hot-reload for license key supplied by `-licenseFile` command-line flag.

* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): make instant query results consistent. VictoriaMetrics detects and adjusts scrape interval and while this is very useful for range queries (i.e. this eliminates gaps on the graph), it may cause instant queries to return a non-empty result when no result is expected. The fix is to disable scrape interval detection and always use the step as the scrape interval in instant queries. This will guarantee that the samples are searched within the (time-step, time] interval. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5796) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#vmui): fix cursor reset in query input field. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7288).
* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/): properly handle discovery for ipv6 addresses. Thanks to @badie for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7955).
* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmctl/): fix support for migrating influx series without any tag. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7921). Thanks to @bitbidu for reporting.
* BUGFIX: `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): storage nodes defined in `-storageNode` are now sorted, ensuring that varying node orders across different vminsert instances do not result in inconsistent replication.
