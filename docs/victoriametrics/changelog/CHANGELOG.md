## [v1.113.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.113.0)

Released at 2025-03-07

**Known issues: this release contains change that could increase CPU usage for vminsert, vmagent, vmsingle for certain type of workloads. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8501) for details. If you are impacted by this, please rollback to [v1.111.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.111.0).**

**Update note 1: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/) include a fix which enforces IPv6 addresses escaping for containers discovered with [Kubernetes service-discovery](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#kubernetes_sd_configs) and `role: pod` which do not have exposed ports defined. This means that `address` for these containers will always be wrapped in square brackets, this might affect some relabeling rules which were relying on previous behaviour.**

**Update note 2: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/) disallows using [time buckets stats pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-by-time-buckets) in alerting or recording rules with VictoriaLogs as datasource. Time buckets used with [stats query API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats) may produce unexpected results for user and result into cardinality issues.**

**Update note 3: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/) disallows specifying `eval_offset` and `eval_delay` options in the same [group](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/#groups). The `eval_offset` option ensures the group is evaluated at the exact offset in the range of [0...interval]. However, with `eval_delay`, this behavior cannot be guaranteed without further adjusting the evaluation time, which could lead to more confusion.**

* FEATURE: upgrade Go builder from Go1.23.6 to Go1.24. See [Go1.24 release notes](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.24).
* FEATURE: provide alternative registry for all VictoriaMetrics components at [Quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/victoriametrics).
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): add a new flag `--storage.trackMetricNamesStats` and a new HTTP API - `/api/v1/status/metric_names_stats`. It allows to track how frequent ingested [metric names](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#structure-of-a-metric) are used during [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#query-data). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4458) for details and related [docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#track-ingested-metrics-usage)
* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): make `KeyValueList`, `ArrayValue` [OpenTelemetry protocol for metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#sending-data-via-opentelemetry) attributes label values compatible with open-telemetry-collector format. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8384).
* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): disallow using [time buckets stats pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-by-time-buckets) in VictoriaLogs rule expressions. Such construction produces meaningless results for [stats query API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats) and may lead to cardinality issues.
* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): remove random sleep before a group starts when `eval_offset` is specified, because `eval_offset` already disperses the group evaluation time, serving the same purpose as the random sleep. This change also enables chaining groups, see [this doc](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/#chaining-groups) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/860).
* FEATURE: [vmalert-tool](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert-tool/): add command-line flag `-httpListenPort` to specify the port used during testing. If not provided, a random unoccupied port will be assigned. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8393).
* FEATURE: [vmalert-tool](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert-tool/): make the temporary storage path for unittest unique, allowing user to run multiple vmalert-tool processes on a single host simultaneously. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8393).
* FEATURE: [alerts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/deployment/docker/rules/alerts-vmalert.yml): add alerting rule `TooHighQueryLoad` to notify user when VictoriaMetrics or vmselect weren't able to serve requests in timely manner during last 15min.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/single](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10229) and [dashboards/cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176): add panel `Deduplication rate` that shows how many samples are [deduplicated](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#deduplication) during merges or read queries by VictoriaMetrics components.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/single](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10229) and [dashboards/cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176): add panel `Number of snapshots` that shows the max number of [snapshots](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-work-with-snapshots) across vmstorage nodes. This panel should help in disk usage [troubleshooting](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#snapshot-troubleshooting).
* FEATURE: [dashboards/single](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10229) and [dashboards/cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176): account for samples dropped according to [relabeling config](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#relabeling) in `Samples dropped for last 1h` panel.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/single](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10229) and [dashboards/cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176): show number of parts in the last partition on `LSM parts max by type` panel. Before, the resulting graph could be skewed by the max number of parts across all partitions. Displaying parts for the latest partition is the correct way to show if storage is currently impacted by merge delays.
* FEATURE: [dashboards/cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176): add panel `Partial query results` that shows the number of served [partial responses](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/#cluster-availability) by vmselects.

* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/): fix the incorrect caching of extMetricsIDs when a query timeout error occurs. This can lead to incorrect query results. Thanks to @changshun-shi for [the bug report issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8345).
* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): respect time filter when exploring time series for [influxdb mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/#migrating-data-from-influxdb-1x). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8259) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/): properly apply global relabeling configuration, defined with  `-relabelConfig` flag, for metrics scrapped with `-promscrape.config`. Bug was introduces in [v1.108.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.108.0). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8389).
* BUGFIX: [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager/): properly propagate an error message when applying retention policy fails. Previously, an actual error messages was discarded.
* BUGFIX: [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway): fix data query in [rate limiter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway/#rate-limiter). The bug was introduced in [this commit](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/commit/68bad22fd26d1436ad0236b1f3ced8604c5d851c) starting from [v1.106.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.106.0).
* BUGFIX: [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway): properly apply the [rate limiter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway/#rate-limiter) for the `rows_inserted` limit type. Previously, the rate limit for this type was ignored.
* BUGFIX: [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway): properly handle HTTP requests with path ending with a trailing `/` when using the [rate limiter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway/#rate-limiter). Previously, the trailing slash was removed and caused an incorrect redirect path when visiting VMUI. Thanks to @jindov for [the bug report issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8439).
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly escape IPv6 address in [Kubernetes service-discovery](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#kubernetes_sd_configs) with `role: pod` for containers without exposed ports. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8374).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert-tool](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert-tool/): clean up the temporary storage path when process is terminated by SIGTERM or SIGINT. Previously, unclean shut down might affect the next run.
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix an infinite loader on the [Downsampling filters debug page](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui) when provided configuration matches no series. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8339).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): fix filters pushdown logic for expression like `foo{a="a"} ifnot bar{a="b"}`. Previously, filters from right operand were incorrectly propagated to the left operand and could result in empty query results even if `foo{a="a"}` matches time series. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8435).
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): prevent possible panic for `foo @ bar` expression when first sample in `bar` starts with `NaN` or starts long after first sample in `foo`. Now, VM will try to find first non-NaN value in `bar` and could yield an error `@ modifier must return a non-NaN value` if it won't find it. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8444).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/): prevent panic when using with rules that have zero interval: `-downsampling.period=5m:5m,0s:0s`. Such rule configuration shouldn't be rejected and cause an error when used. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8454).

* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.23.5 to Go1.23.6. See the list of issues addressed in [Go1.23.6](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.23.6+label%3ACherryPickApproved).
* SECURITY: upgrade base docker image (Alpine) from 3.21.2 to 3.21.3. See [Alpine 3.21.3 release notes](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.18.12-3.19.7-3.20.6-3.21.3-released.html).

* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/): allow [disabling per-day indexes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#index-tuning-for-low-churn-rate) for workloads with low or zero churn rates via `-disablePerDayIndex` cmd-line flag. This option works the best for IoT cases and significantly loads resource and disk usage. See [this PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6976).
* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): add command-line flag `-notifier.sendTimeout(default 10s)` to allow configuring request timeout when sending alerts to the corresponding `-notifier.url`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8287) for details. Thanks to @gjkim42 for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8297).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/) and [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/): add support of [aggregation windows](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#aggregation-windows) to improve accuracy of stream aggregation. This feature is especially important for aggregation of [histrograms](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#histogram), but enabling this feature requires additional memory. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4580).
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): add `-influx.forceStreamMode` cmd-line flag to force stream processing for data ingested via [InfluxDB protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-send-data-from-influxdb-compatible-agents-such-as-telegraf).

* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add legend customization options - table view, hiding common values, grouping by label, and custom label format. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8031) and [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8263).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): look back for recent data for longer time intervals when switching to Table or JSON view. The look back window depends on the `step` setting, which is now set as `end - start` (30m) by default. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8240).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): preserve user-defined `step` setting when changing the time interval of displayed query. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8240#issuecomment-2647674065).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): improve numbers formatting for better readability on the `Explore Cardinality` page. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8318).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): print full error messages for failed queries on the `Explore Cardinality` page. Before, only response status code was printed. 
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): move values representing changes relative to the previous day to a separate column for easier sorting on the `Explore Cardinality` page.
* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): parse `$__interval` and `$__rate_interval` inside square brackets as missing square brackets. For example, `rate(m[$__interval])` is parsed as `rate(m)` instead of `rate(m[1i])`. This enables automatic detection of the lookbehind window for [rollup functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#rollup-functions) by VictoriaMetrics, which usually returns the most expected result.
* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): support auto-format (prettify) for expressions that use quoted metric or label names. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7703) for details.

* BUGFIX: all the VictoriaMetrics components: properly override basic authorization for API endpoints protected with `authKey`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7345#issuecomment-2662595807) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): fix polluted alert messages when multiple Alertmanager instances are configured with `alert_relabel_configs`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8040), and thanks to @evkuzin for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8258).
* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): fix the auto-generated metrics for alerts and groups. Previously, metrics might be missing after reload. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8229) for the details.
* BUGFIX: `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly return parsing errors during data ingestion in [multi-level cluster setup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/#multi-level-cluster-setup). Before, some of the errors could have been silently ignored.
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/),  `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): fix negative rate result when the lookbehind window is longer than `-search.maxLookback` or `-search.maxStalenessInterval` and data contains gap. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8342).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly enforce presence of default `-retentionPeriod` configuration for [retention filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#retention-filters) debug interface. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8343).

## [v1.111.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.111.0)

Released at 2025-02-10

**Update note 1: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/) stop exposing `vm_index_search_duration_seconds` histogram metric. This metric records time spent on search operations in the index. It was introduced in [v1.56.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.56.0). However, this metric was used neither in dashboards nor in alerting rules. It also has high cardinality because index search operations latency can differ by 3 orders of magnitude. Hence, dropping it as unused.**

* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): improve startup times when opening a storage with the [retention](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#retention) exceeding a few months.
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add the ability to switch the heatmap to a line chart. Now, vmui would suggest to switch to line graph display if heatmap can't be properly rendered. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8057).
* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): add `-httpInternalListenAddr` cmd-line flag to serve internal HTTP routes `/metrics`, `/flags`, etc. It allows properly route requests to backends with the same service routes as vmauth. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6468) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7345) for details.
* FEATURE: expose `/-/healthy` and `/-/ready` endpoints as Prometheus does on vmselect endpoints, thus achieving full Prometheus compatibility for external dependencies.

* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly perform graceful shutdown for kafka client.
* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly add message metadata headers for kafka remoteWrite target.
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): improve clipboard error handling in tables and code snippets by showing detailed messages with possible reasons. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7778).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui) for [VictoriaMetrics enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html) components: properly display enterprise features when the enterprise version is used.
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): fix discrepancies when using `or` binary operator. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7759) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7640) issues for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly update number of unique series for [cardinality limiter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#cardinality-limiter) on ingestion. Previously, limit could undercount the real number of the ingested unique series.

The v1.110.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.110.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v11100) release**

**Update note 1: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/) include a fix which enforces IPv6 addresses escaping for containers discovered with [Kubernetes service-discovery](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#kubernetes_sd_configs) and `role: pod` which do not have exposed ports defined. This means that `address` for these containers will always be wrapped in square brackets, this might affect some relabeling rules which were relying on previous behaviour.**

* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/): fix the incorrect caching of extMetricsIDs when a query timeout error occurs. This can lead to incorrect query results. Thanks to @changshun-shi for [the bug report issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8345).

* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix an infinite loader on the [Downsampling filters debug page](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui) when provided configuration matches no series. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8339).
* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): fix filters pushdown logic for expression like `foo{a="a"} ifnot bar{a="b"}`. Previously, filters from right operand were incorrectly propagated to the left operand and could result in empty query results even if `foo{a="a"}` matches time series. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8435).
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): prevent possible panic for `foo @ bar` expression when first sample in `bar` starts with `NaN` or starts long after first sample in `foo`. Now, VM will try to find first non-NaN value in `bar` and could yield an error `@ modifier must return a non-NaN value` if it won't find it. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8444).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/): prevent panic when using with rules that have zero interval: `-downsampling.period=5m:5m,0s:0s`.

## [v1.109.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.109.0)

Released at 2025-01-14

**Update note: This release contains [issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8045) that might affect correctness of increase, increase_pure and delta functions. It affects only vmselect or VictoriaMetrics single-node on query time. Please, rollback vmselects to the closest previous version or update to [v1.109.1](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v11091).**

* FEATURE: all the VictoriaMetrics components: increase the default value for [`GOGC`](https://tip.golang.org/doc/gc-guide#GOGC) from `30` to `100`. This should reduce CPU usage at the cost of slightly higher memory usage. [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/), [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/#architecture-overview) components continue using `GOGC=30`, since they are optimized for low memory allocations and low memory usage, so they do not benefit from the increased GOGC value too much. It is possible to override the default `GOGC` value in any VictoriaMetrics component by setting `GOGC` environment variable to the desired value. For example, `GOGC=200 ./path/to/vmagent` starts `vmagent` with `GOGC=200`. See [these docs](https://tip.golang.org/doc/gc-guide#GOGC) about `GOGC` tuning. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7902).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add export data functionality for the `Raw Query` page and the ability to import exported data into the `Query Analyzer` page. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7628).
* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add `markdown` support for comments during data export. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7828).
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/) and [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/): added `min` and `max` metrics for Datadog Sketches API metrics, changed `_` metric name separator to `.` if metrics are not sanitized for consistency.
* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/) and [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/): add service discovery support for [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs/#marathon_sd_configs) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6642).
* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/): support `-maxIngestionRate` cmd-line flag to ratelimit samples/sec ingested. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7377) for details.
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): improve query performance on systems with high number of CPU cores. See [this PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7416) for details.
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): add command-line flag `-search.maxBinaryOpPushdownLabelValues` to allow using labels with more candidate values as push down filter in binary operation. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7243). Thanks to @tydhot for implementation.
* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): add command-line flag `storage.finalDedupScheduleCheckInterval` to control the final deduplication process interval. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7880) for details.
* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): add a separate cache type for storing sparse entries when performing large index scans. This significantly reduces memory usage when applying [downsampling filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling) and [retention filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#retention-filters) during background merge. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7182) for the details.

* BUGFIX: [dashboards](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/dashboards): consistently use `vmagent_remotewrite_pending_data_bytes` on vmagent dashboard to represent persistent queue size.

* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): properly handle discovery for ipv6 addresses. Thanks to @badie for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7955).
* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): fix support for migrating influx series without any tag. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7921). Thanks to @bitbidu for reporting.
* BUGFIX: `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): storage nodes defined in `-storageNode` are now sorted, ensuring that varying node orders across different vminsert instances do not result in inconsistent replication.
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly ingest `influx` line protocol metrics with empty tags.

* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/) components: properly trim whitespaces at the end of license provided via `-license` and `-licenseFile` command-line flags. Previously, the trailing whitespaces could cause the license verification to fail.
* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/) components: remove unnecessary delay before failing if all online verification attempts have failed. This should reduce the time required for the component to proceed if all online verification attempts have failed.
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): don't take into account the last raw sample before the lookbehind window is sample exceeds the staleness interval.

## [v1.102.10](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.102.10)

Released at 2025-01-14

**v1.102.x is a line of [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/). It contains important up-to-date bugfixes for [VictoriaMetrics enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html).
All these fixes are also included in [the latest community release](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest).
The v1.102.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.102.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v11020) release**

* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/) components: add support of hot-reload for license key supplied by `-licenseFile` command-line flag.

* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): make instant query results consistent. VictoriaMetrics detects and adjusts scrape interval and while this is very useful for range queries (i.e. this eliminates gaps on the graph), it may cause instant queries to return a non-empty result when no result is expected. The fix is to disable scrape interval detection and always use the step as the scrape interval in instant queries. This will guarantee that the samples are searched within the (time-step, time] interval. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5796) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix cursor reset in query input field. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7288).
* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): properly handle discovery for ipv6 addresses. Thanks to @badie for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7955).
* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): fix support for migrating influx series without any tag. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7921). Thanks to @bitbidu for reporting.
* BUGFIX: `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): storage nodes defined in `-storageNode` are now sorted, ensuring that varying node orders across different vminsert instances do not result in inconsistent replication.

## [v1.97.17](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.97.17)

Released at 2025-01-28

**v1.97.x is a line of [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/). It contains important up-to-date bugfixes for [VictoriaMetrics enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html).
All these fixes are also included in [the latest community release](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest).
The v1.97.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.97.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1970) release**

* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): log metric names for signals with unsupported delta temporality on ingestion via [OpenTelemetry protocol for metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#sending-data-via-opentelemetry). Thanks to @chenlujjj for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8018).
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): respect staleness detection in increase, increase_pure and delta functions when time series has gaps and `-search.maxStalenessInterval` is set. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8072) for details.

## [v1.97.16](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.97.16)

Released at 2025-01-24

It is recommended upgrading to [v1.97.17](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v19717) because [v1.97.16](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v19716) contains a bug with staleness detection.

**v1.97.x is a line of [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/). It contains important up-to-date bugfixes for [VictoriaMetrics enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html).
All these fixes are also included in [the latest community release](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest).
The v1.97.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.97.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1970) release**

* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/) components: remove unnecessary delay before failing if all online verification attempts have failed. This should reduce the time required for the component to proceed if all online verification attempts have failed.
* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): don't take into account the last raw sample before the lookbehind window is sample exceeds the staleness interval. This affects correctness of increase, increase_pure, delta functions when performing calculations on time series with gaps. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8002) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): allow ingesting histograms with missing `_sum` metric via [OpenTelemetry ingestion protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#sending-data-via-opentelemetry) in the same way as Prometheus does.

## [v1.97.15](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.97.15)

Released at 2025-01-14

**v1.97.x is a line of [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/lts-releases/). It contains important up-to-date bugfixes for [VictoriaMetrics enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html).
All these fixes are also included in [the latest community release](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest).
The v1.97.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.97.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v1970) release**

* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/) components: add support of hot-reload for license key supplied by `-licenseFile` command-line flag.

* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): make instant query results consistent. VictoriaMetrics detects and adjusts scrape interval and while this is very useful for range queries (i.e. this eliminates gaps on the graph), it may cause instant queries to return a non-empty result when no result is expected. The fix is to disable scrape interval detection and always use the step as the scrape interval in instant queries. This will guarantee that the samples are searched within the (time-step, time] interval. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5796) for details.
* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): fix support for migrating influx series without any tag. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7921). Thanks to @bitbidu for reporting.
