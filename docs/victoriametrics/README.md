## Prominent features

VictoriaMetrics has the following prominent features:

* It can be used as long-term storage for Prometheus. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/prometheus/) for details.
* It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus in Grafana, because it supports the [Prometheus querying API](#prometheus-querying-api-usage).
* It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Graphite in Grafana, because it supports the [Graphite API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/graphite/#graphite-api-usage).
  VictoriaMetrics allows reducing infrastructure costs by more than 10x comparing to Graphite - see [this case study](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/casestudies/#grammarly).
* It is easy to setup and operate:
  * VictoriaMetrics consists of a single [small executable](https://medium.com/@valyala/stripping-dependency-bloat-in-victoriametrics-docker-image-983fb5912b0d)
    without external dependencies.
  * All the configuration is done via explicit command-line flags with reasonable defaults.
  * All the data is stored in a single directory specified by the `-storageDataPath` command-line flag.
  * Easy and fast backups from [instant snapshots](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282)
    can be done with [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackup/) / [vmrestore](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmrestore/) tools.
    See [this article](https://medium.com/@valyala/speeding-up-backups-for-big-time-series-databases-533c1a927883) for more details.
* It implements a PromQL-like query language - [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/metricsql/), which provides improved functionality on top of PromQL.
* It provides a global query view. Multiple Prometheus instances or any other data sources may ingest data into VictoriaMetrics. Later this data may be queried via a single query.
* It provides high performance and good vertical and horizontal scalability for both
  [data ingestion](https://medium.com/@valyala/high-cardinality-tsdb-benchmarks-victoriametrics-vs-timescaledb-vs-influxdb-13e6ee64dd6b)
  and [data querying](https://medium.com/@valyala/when-size-matters-benchmarking-victoriametrics-vs-timescale-and-influxdb-6035811952d4).
  It [outperforms InfluxDB and TimescaleDB by up to 20x](https://medium.com/@valyala/measuring-vertical-scalability-for-time-series-databases-in-google-cloud-92550d78d8ae).
* It [uses 10x less RAM than InfluxDB](https://medium.com/@valyala/insert-benchmarks-with-inch-influxdb-vs-victoriametrics-e31a41ae2893)
  and [up to 7x less RAM than Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex](https://valyala.medium.com/prometheus-vs-victoriametrics-benchmark-on-node-exporter-metrics-4ca29c75590f)
  when dealing with millions of unique time series (aka [high cardinality](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-high-cardinality)).
* It is optimized for time series with [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-high-churn-rate).
* It provides high data compression: up to 70x more data points may be stored into limited storage compared with TimescaleDB
  according to [these benchmarks](https://medium.com/@valyala/when-size-matters-benchmarking-victoriametrics-vs-timescale-and-influxdb-6035811952d4),
  and up to 7x less storage space is required compared to Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex.
  according to [this benchmark](https://valyala.medium.com/prometheus-vs-victoriametrics-benchmark-on-node-exporter-metrics-4ca29c75590f).
* It is optimized for storage with high-latency IO and low IOPS (HDD and network storage in AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc).
  See [disk IO graphs from these benchmarks](https://medium.com/@valyala/high-cardinality-tsdb-benchmarks-victoriametrics-vs-timescaledb-vs-influxdb-13e6ee64dd6b).
* A single-node VictoriaMetrics may substitute moderately sized clusters built with competing solutions such as Thanos, M3DB, Cortex, InfluxDB or TimescaleDB.

## Operation

### Install

To quickly try VictoriaMetrics, just download the [VictoriaMetrics executable](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest)
or docker image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/victoria-metrics/) or [Quay](https://quay.io/repository/victoriametrics/victoria-metrics?tab=tags) and start it with the desired command-line flags.
See also [QuickStart guide](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/quick-start/) for additional information.

VictoriaMetrics can also be installed via these installation methods:

* [Helm charts for single-node and cluster versions of VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts).
* [Kubernetes operator for VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator).
* [Ansible role for installing cluster VictoriaMetrics (by VictoriaMetrics)](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/ansible-playbooks).
* [Ansible role for installing cluster VictoriaMetrics (by community)](https://github.com/Slapper/ansible-victoriametrics-cluster-role).
* [Ansible role for installing single-node VictoriaMetrics (by community)](https://github.com/dreamteam-gg/ansible-victoriametrics-role).

### How to start VictoriaMetrics

The following command-line flags are used the most:

* `-storageDataPath` - VictoriaMetrics stores all the data in this directory. The default path is `victoria-metrics-data` in the current working directory.
* `-retentionPeriod` - retention for stored data. Older data is automatically deleted. Default retention is 1 month (31 days). The minimum retention period is 24h or 1d. See [these docs](#retention) for more details.

Other flags have good enough default values, so set them only if you really need to. Pass `-help` to see [all the available flags with description and default values](#list-of-command-line-flags).

The following docs may be useful during initial VictoriaMetrics setup:

* [How to set up scraping of Prometheus-compatible targets](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#how-to-scrape-prometheus-exporters-such-as-node-exporter)
* [How to ingest data to VictoriaMetrics](#how-to-import-time-series-data)
* [How to set up Prometheus to write data to VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/prometheus/)
* [How to query VictoriaMetrics via Grafana](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/grafana/)
* [How to query VictoriaMetrics via Graphite API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/graphite/#graphite-api-usage)
* [How to handle alerts](#alerting)

VictoriaMetrics accepts [Prometheus querying API requests](#prometheus-querying-api-usage) on port `8428` by default.

It is recommended setting up [monitoring](#monitoring) for VictoriaMetrics.

### Environment variables

All the VictoriaMetrics components allow referring environment variables in `yaml` configuration files (such as `-promscrape.config`)
and in command-line flags via `%{ENV_VAR}` syntax.
For example, `-metricsAuthKey=%{METRICS_AUTH_KEY}` is automatically expanded to `-metricsAuthKey=top-secret`
if `METRICS_AUTH_KEY=top-secret` environment variable exists at VictoriaMetrics startup.
This expansion is performed by VictoriaMetrics itself.

VictoriaMetrics recursively expands `%{ENV_VAR}` references in environment variables on startup.
For example, `FOO=%{BAR}` environment variable is expanded to `FOO=abc` if `BAR=a%{BAZ}` and `BAZ=bc` environment variables exist.

Additionally, all the VictoriaMetrics components allow setting flag values via environment variables according to these rules:

* The `-envflag.enable` flag must be set.
* Each `.` char in flag name must be substituted with `_` (for example `-insert.maxQueueDuration <duration>` will translate to `insert_maxQueueDuration=<duration>`).
* Repeated flags can be replaced by an environment variable with comma separated values for the repeated flags.
  For example `-storageNode <nodeA> -storageNode <nodeB>` command-line flags can be set as `storageNode=<nodeA>,<nodeB>` environment variable.
* Environment var prefix can be set via `-envflag.prefix` flag. For instance, if `-envflag.prefix=VM_`, then env vars must be prepended with `VM_`.

### Setting up service

Read [instructions](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/43) on how to set up VictoriaMetrics
as a service for your OS. See also [ansible playbooks](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/ansible-playbooks).

    ```sh
    winsw install VictoriaMetrics.xml
    Get-Service VictoriaMetrics | Start-Service
    ```

See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3781) for more details.

### Start with docker-compose

[Docker-compose](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker#readme)
helps to spin up VictoriaMetrics, [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/) and Grafana with one command.

## Playgrounds

VictoriaMetrics has the following publicly available demo resources:

1. [https://play.victoriametrics.com/](https://play.victoriametrics.com/) - [VMUI](#vmui) of VictoriaMetrics cluster installation.
  It is available for testing the query engine, relabeling debugger, other tools and pages provided by VMUI.
1. [https://play-grafana.victoriametrics.com/](https://play-grafana.victoriametrics.com/) - Grafana configured with many
  typical dashboards using VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs as datasource. It contains VictoriaMetrics cluster dashboard with
  3 cluster installations for the recent OS and LTS versions running under the constant benchmark.
1. [https://play-vmlogs.victoriametrics.com/](https://play-vmlogs.victoriametrics.com/) - [VMUI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui) of VictoriaLogs installation.
   It is available for testing the query engine on demo logs set.

Additionally, we provide a [docker-compose environment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker#docker-compose-environment-for-victoriametrics)
for VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs components. They are already configured, provisioned and interconnected.
It can be used as an example for a [quick start](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/quick-start/).

## How to upgrade VictoriaMetrics

VictoriaMetrics is developed at a fast pace, so it is recommended periodically checking [the CHANGELOG page](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/changelog/) and performing regular upgrades.

It is safe upgrading VictoriaMetrics to new versions unless [release notes](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest) say otherwise.
It is safe skipping multiple versions during the upgrade unless [release notes](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest) say otherwise.
It is recommended performing regular upgrades to the latest version, since it may contain important bug fixes, performance optimizations or new features.

It is also safe downgrading to older versions unless [release notes](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest) say otherwise.

The following steps must be performed during the upgrade / downgrade procedure:

* Send `SIGINT` signal to VictoriaMetrics process in order to gracefully stop it. See [how to send signals to processes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33239959/send-signal-to-process-from-command-line).
* Wait until the process stops. This can take a few seconds.
* Start the upgraded VictoriaMetrics.

Prometheus doesn't drop data during VictoriaMetrics restart. See [this article](https://grafana.com/blog/2019/03/25/whats-new-in-prometheus-2.8-wal-based-remote-write/) for details. The same applies also to [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/).

## vmui

VictoriaMetrics provides UI for query troubleshooting and exploration. The UI is available at `http://victoriametrics:8428/vmui`
(or at `http://<vmselect>:8481/select/<accountID>/vmui/` in [cluster version of VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/)).

> See [VMUI at VictoriaMetrics playground](https://play.victoriametrics.com?g0.expr=up).

VMUI provides the following features:

* `Query` tab for ad-hoc queries in MetricsQL, supporting time series, tables and histogram representation
* `Raw Query` tab {{% available_from "v1.107.0" %}} for viewing [raw samples](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#raw-samples). Helps in debugging of [unexpected query results](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/troubleshooting/#unexpected-query-results).
* Explore:
  * [Metrics explorer](#metrics-explorer) - automatically builds graphs for selected metrics;
  * [Cardinality explorer](#cardinality-explorer) - stats about existing metrics in TSDB;
  * [Top queries](#top-queries) - shows most frequently executed queries;
  * [Active queries](#active-queries) - shows currently executed queries;
* Tools:
  * [Trace analyzer](#query-tracing) - explore query traces loaded from JSON;
  * [Query analyzer](#query-tracing) - explore query results and traces loaded from JSON. See `Export query` button below;
  * [WITH expressions playground](https://play.victoriametrics.com/select/accounting/1/6a716b0f-38bc-4856-90ce-448fd713e3fe/prometheus/graph/#/expand-with-exprs) - test how WITH expressions work;
  * [Metric relabel debugger](https://play.victoriametrics.com/select/accounting/1/6a716b0f-38bc-4856-90ce-448fd713e3fe/prometheus/graph/#/relabeling) - debug [relabeling](#relabeling) rules.
  * [Downsampling filters debugger](https://play.victoriametrics.com/select/accounting/1/6a716b0f-38bc-4856-90ce-448fd713e3fe/prometheus/graph/#/downsampling-filters-debug) {{% available_from "v1.105.0" %}} - debug [downsampling](#downsampling) configs.
  * [Retention filters debugger](https://play.victoriametrics.com/select/accounting/1/6a716b0f-38bc-4856-90ce-448fd713e3fe/prometheus/graph/#/retention-filters-debug) {{% available_from "v1.105.0" %}} - debug [retention filter](#retention-filters) configs.
* `Alerting` {{% available_from "v1.125.0" %}} for displaying groups and rules from the [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/) service.
  The tab is available only if [VictoriaMetrics single-node](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#vmalert) or
  [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#vmalert) are configured with `-vmalert.proxyURL` command-line flag.

**Querying:**

Enter the MetricsQL query in `Query` field and hit `Enter`. Multi-line queries can be entered by pressing `Shift-Enter`.

VMUI provides auto-completion for [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/metricsql/) functions, metric names, label names and label values.
The auto-completion can be enabled by checking the `Autocomplete` toggle. When the auto-completion is disabled, it can
still be triggered for the current cursor position by pressing `ctrl+space`.

To correlate between multiple queries on the same graph click `Add Query` button and enter an additional query.
Results for all the queries are displayed simultaneously on the same graph.

Results of a particular query can be hidden by clicking the `eye` icon on the right side of the input field.
Clicking on the `eye` icon while holding the `ctrl` key hides results of all other queries.

VMUI automatically adjusts the interval between datapoints on the graph depending on the horizontal resolution and on the selected time range.
The step value can be customized by changing `Step` value in the top-right corner.

Clicking on the line on graph pins the tooltip. User can pin multiple tooltips. Press `x` icon to unpin the tooltip.

Query history can be navigated by holding `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on MacOS) and pressing `up` or `down` arrows on the keyboard while the cursor is located in the query input field.

VMUI automatically switches from graph view to heatmap view when the query returns [histogram](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#histogram) buckets
(both [Prometheus histograms](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram)
and [VictoriaMetrics histograms](https://valyala.medium.com/improving-histogram-usability-for-prometheus-and-grafana-bc7e5df0e350) are supported).
Try, for example, [this query](https://play.victoriametrics.com/select/accounting/1/6a716b0f-38bc-4856-90ce-448fd713e3fe/prometheus/graph/#/?g0.expr=sum%28rate%28vm_promscrape_scrape_duration_seconds_bucket%29%29+by+%28vmrange%29&g0.range_input=24h&g0.end_input=2023-04-10T17%3A46%3A12&g0.relative_time=last_24_hours&g0.step_input=31m).
To disable heatmap view press on settings icon in the top-right corner of graph area and disable `Histogram mode` toggle.

**Time range:**

The time range for graphs can be adjusted in multiple ways:

* Click on time picker in the top-right corner to select a relative (`Last N minutes`) or absolute time range (specify `From` and `To`);
* Zoom-in into graph by click-and-drag motion over the graph area;
* When hovering cursor over the graph area, hold `ctrl` (or `cmd` on MacOS) and scroll up or down to zoom out or zoom in;
* When hovering cursor over the graph area, hold `ctrl` (or `cmd` on MacOS) and drag the graph to the left / right to move the displayed time range into the future / past.

**Legend:**

Legend is displayed below the graph area.
Clicking on item in legend hides all other items from displaying. Clicking on the item while holding the `ctrl` key hides
only this item.

Clicking on the label-value pair in item automatically copies it into buffer, so it can be pasted later.

There are additional visualization settings in the top right-corner of the legend view: switching to table view,
hiding common labels, etc.

**Troubleshooting:**

When querying the [backfilled data](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#backfilling)
or during [query troubleshooting](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/troubleshooting/#unexpected-query-results),
it may be useful disabling response cache by clicking `Disable cache` checkbox.

Query can be [traced](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#query-tracing)
by clicking on `Trace query` toggle below query input area and executing query again. Once trace is generated, click
on it to expand for more details.

The query and its trace can be exported by clicking on `debug` icon in top right corner of trace block. The exported file
file can be loaded again in VMUI on `Tools=>Query Analyzer` page.

`Raw query` page allows displaying raw, unmodified data. It can be useful for seeing the actual scrape interval or detecting
sample duplicates.

### Top queries

[VMUI](#vmui) provides `top queries` tab, which can help determining the following query types:

* the most frequently executed queries;
* queries with the biggest average execution duration;
* queries that took the most summary time for execution.

This information is obtained from the `/api/v1/status/top_queries` HTTP endpoint.

### Active queries

[VMUI](#vmui) provides `active queries` tab, which shows currently execute queries.
It provides the following information per each query:

* The query itself, together with the time range and step args passed to [/api/v1/query_range](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#range-query).
* The duration of the query execution.
* The client address, who initiated the query execution.

This information is obtained from the `/api/v1/status/active_queries` HTTP endpoint.

### Metrics explorer

[VMUI](#vmui) provides an ability to explore metrics exported by a particular `job` / `instance` in the following way:

1. Open the `vmui` at `http://victoriametrics:8428/vmui/`.
1. Click the `Explore Prometheus metrics` tab.
1. Select the `job` you want to explore.
1. Optionally select the `instance` for the selected job to explore.
1. Select metrics you want to explore and compare.

It is possible to change the selected time range for the graphs in the top right corner.

### Cardinality explorer

VictoriaMetrics provides an ability to explore [time series cardinality](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#cardinality)
at `Explore cardinality` tab in [vmui](#vmui):

* [Metric](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#what-is-a-metric) names with the highest number of series.
* [Labels](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#labels) with the highest number of series.
* Values with the highest number of series for the selected label (aka `focusLabel`).
* `label=name` pairs with the highest number of series.
* Labels with the highest number of unique values.
* Read usage statistics of metric names, based on [metric name usage tracker](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#track-ingested-metrics-usage).
  Shows the number of times the metric name was queried (`Requests count`), and the last time (`Last request`) when it was queried.

Note that [cluster version of VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/)
may show lower than expected number of unique label values for labels with small number of unique values.
This is because of [implementation limits](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/5a6e617b5e41c9170e7c562aecd15ee0c901d489/app/vmselect/netstorage/netstorage.go#L1039-L1045).

By default, cardinality explorer analyzes time series for the **current date**. It provides the ability to **select different day at the top right corner**.
By default, all the time series for the selected date are analyzed. To narrow down the analysis specify [series selector](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-series-selectors).

Cardinality explorer is built on top of [/api/v1/status/tsdb](#tsdb-stats).

Resources:

* [cardinality explorer playground](https://play.victoriametrics.com/select/accounting/1/6a716b0f-38bc-4856-90ce-448fd713e3fe/prometheus/graph/#/cardinality).
* [Cardinality explorer blog post](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/cardinality-explorer/).

### Cardinality explorer statistic inaccuracy

In [cluster version of VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/) each vmstorage tracks the stored time series individually.
vmselect requests stats via [/api/v1/status/tsdb](#tsdb-stats) API from each vmstorage node and merges the results by summing per-series stats.
This may lead to inflated values when samples for the same time series are spread across multiple vmstorage nodes
due to [replication](#replication) or [rerouting](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#cluster-availability).

## How to apply new config to VictoriaMetrics

VictoriaMetrics is configured via command-line flags, so it must be restarted when new command-line flags should be applied:

* Send `SIGINT` signal to VictoriaMetrics process in order to gracefully stop it.
* Wait until the process stops. This can take a few seconds.
* Start VictoriaMetrics with the new command-line flags.

Prometheus doesn't drop data during VictoriaMetrics restart. See [this article](https://grafana.com/blog/2019/03/25/whats-new-in-prometheus-2.8-wal-based-remote-write/) for details. The same applies also to [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/).

## How to scrape Prometheus exporters such as [node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)

VictoriaMetrics can be used as drop-in replacement for Prometheus for scraping targets configured in `prometheus.yml` config file
according to [the specification](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#configuration-file).
Just set `-promscrape.config` command-line flag to the path to `prometheus.yml` config - and VictoriaMetrics should start scraping the configured targets.
If the provided configuration file contains [unsupported options](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/#unsupported-prometheus-config-sections),
then either delete them from the file or just pass `-promscrape.config.strictParse=false` command-line flag to VictoriaMetrics, so it will ignore unsupported options.

The file pointed by `-promscrape.config` may contain `%{ENV_VAR}` placeholders, which are substituted by the corresponding `ENV_VAR` environment variable values.

See also:

* [scrape config examples](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/scrape_config_examples/)
* [the list of supported service discovery types for Prometheus scrape targets](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/sd_configs/)

VictoriaMetrics also supports [importing data in Prometheus exposition format](#how-to-import-data-in-prometheus-exposition-format).

See also [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/), which can be used as drop-in replacement for Prometheus.

## Prometheus querying API usage

VictoriaMetrics supports the following handlers from [Prometheus querying API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/):

* [/api/v1/query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#instant-query)
* [/api/v1/query_range](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#range-query)
* [/api/v1/series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1series)
* [/api/v1/labels](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1labels)
* [/api/v1/label/.../values](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1labelvalues)
* [/api/v1/status/tsdb](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#tsdb-stats). See [these docs](#tsdb-stats) for details.
* [/api/v1/targets](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#targets) - see [these docs](#how-to-scrape-prometheus-exporters-such-as-node-exporter) for more details.
* [/federate](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/) - see [these docs](#federation) for more details.

These handlers can be queried from Prometheus-compatible clients such as Grafana or curl.
All the Prometheus querying API handlers can be prepended with `/prometheus` prefix. For example, both `/prometheus/api/v1/query` and `/api/v1/query` should work.

### Prometheus querying API enhancements

VictoriaMetrics accepts optional `extra_label=<label_name>=<label_value>` query arg, which can be used
for enforcing additional label filters for queries. For example, `/api/v1/query_range?extra_label=user_id=123&extra_label=group_id=456&query=<query>`
would automatically add `{user_id="123",group_id="456"}` label filters to the given `<query>`.
This functionality can be used for limiting the scope of time series visible to the given tenant.
It is expected that the `extra_label` query args are automatically set by auth proxy sitting in front of VictoriaMetrics.
See [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) and [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmgateway/) as examples of such proxies.

VictoriaMetrics accepts optional `extra_filters[]=series_selector` query arg, which can be used for enforcing arbitrary label filters for queries.
For example, `/api/v1/query_range?extra_filters[]={env=~"prod|staging",user="xyz"}&query=<query>` would automatically
add `{env=~"prod|staging",user="xyz"}` label filters to the given `<query>`. This functionality can be used for limiting
the scope of time series visible to the given tenant. It is expected that the `extra_filters[]` query args are automatically
set by auth proxy sitting in front of VictoriaMetrics.
See [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) and [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmgateway/) as examples of such proxies.

VictoriaMetrics accepts multiple formats for `time`, `start` and `end` query args - see [these docs](#timestamp-formats).

VictoriaMetrics accepts `round_digits` query arg for [/api/v1/query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#instant-query)
and [/api/v1/query_range](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#range-query) handlers. It can be used for rounding response values
to the given number of digits after the decimal point.
For example, `/api/v1/query?query=avg_over_time(temperature[1h])&round_digits=2` would round response values to up to two digits after the decimal point.

VictoriaMetrics accepts `limit` query arg for [/api/v1/labels](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1labels)
and [`/api/v1/label/<labelName>/values`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1labelvalues) handlers for limiting the number of returned entries.
For example, the query to `/api/v1/labels?limit=5` returns a sample of up to 5 unique labels, while ignoring the rest of labels.
If the provided `limit` value exceeds the corresponding `-search.maxTagKeys` / `-search.maxTagValues` command-line flag values,
then limits specified in the command-line flags are used.

By default, VictoriaMetrics returns time series for the last day starting at 00:00 UTC
from [/api/v1/series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1series),
[/api/v1/labels](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1labels) and
[`/api/v1/label/<labelName>/values`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1labelvalues),
while the Prometheus API defaults to all time.  Explicitly set `start` and `end` to select the desired time range.
VictoriaMetrics rounds the specified `start..end` time range to day granularity because of performance optimization concerns.
If you need the exact set of label names and label values on the given time range, then send queries
to [/api/v1/query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#instant-query) or to [/api/v1/query_range](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#range-query).

VictoriaMetrics accepts `limit` query arg at [/api/v1/series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1series)
for limiting the number of returned entries. For example, the query to `/api/v1/series?limit=5` returns a sample of up to 5 series, while ignoring the rest of series.
If the provided `limit` value exceeds the corresponding `-search.maxSeries` command-line flag values, then limits specified in the command-line flags are used.

VictoriaMetrics returns an extra object `stats` in JSON response for [`/api/v1/query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#instant-query)
and [`/api/v1/query_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#range-query) APIs. This object contains two
fields: `executionTimeMsec` with number of milliseconds the request took and `seriesFetched` with number of series that
were fetched from database before filtering. The `seriesFetched` field is effectively used by vmalert for detecting
[misconfigured rule expressions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#never-firing-alerts). Please note, `seriesFetched`
provides approximate number of series, it is not recommended to rely on it in tests.

Additionally, VictoriaMetrics provides the following handlers:

* `/vmui` - Basic Web UI. See [these docs](#vmui).
* `/api/v1/series/count` - returns the total number of time series in the database. Some notes:
  * the handler scans all [IndexDBs](#indexdb) entirely, so it can be slow if the database contains tens of millions of time series;
  * it can return an inflated value if the same time series is stored in more than one IndexDB.
  * the handler may count [deleted time series](#how-to-delete-time-series) additionally to normal time series due to internal implementation restrictions;
* `/api/v1/status/active_queries` - returns the list of currently running queries. This list is also available at [`active queries` page at VMUI](#active-queries).
* `/api/v1/status/top_queries` - returns the following query lists:
  * the most frequently executed queries - `topByCount`
  * queries with the biggest average execution duration - `topByAvgDuration`
  * queries that took the most time for execution - `topBySumDuration`

  The number of returned queries can be limited via `topN` query arg. Old queries can be filtered out with `maxLifetime` query arg.
  For example, request to `/api/v1/status/top_queries?topN=5&maxLifetime=30s` would return up to 5 queries per list, which were executed during the last 30 seconds.
  VictoriaMetrics tracks the last `-search.queryStats.lastQueriesCount` queries with durations at least `-search.queryStats.minQueryDuration`.

  See also [`top queries` page at VMUI](#top-queries).

### Timestamp formats

VictoriaMetrics accepts the following formats for `time`, `start` and `end` query args
in [query APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#prometheus-querying-api-usage) and
in [export APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#how-to-export-time-series).

* Unix timestamps in seconds with optional milliseconds after the point. For example, `1562529662.678`.
* Unix timestamps in milliseconds. For example, `1562529662678`.
* Unix timestamps in microseconds. For example, `1562529662678901`.
* Unix timestamps in nanoseconds. For example, `1562529662678901234`.
* [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt). For example, `2022-03-29T01:02:03Z` or `2022-03-29T01:02:03+02:30`.
* Partial RFC3339. Examples: `2022`, `2022-03`, `2022-03-29`, `2022-03-29T01`, `2022-03-29T01:02`, `2022-03-29T01:02:03`.
  The partial RFC3339 time is in local timezone of the host where VictoriaMetrics runs.
  It is possible to specify the needed timezone by adding `Z` (UTC), `+hh:mm` or `-hh:mm` suffix to partial time.
  For example, `2022-03-01Z` corresponds to the given date in UTC timezone, while `2022-03-01+06:30` corresponds to `2022-03-01` date at `06:30` timezone.
* Relative duration comparing to the current time. For example, `1h5m`, `-1h5m` or `now-1h5m` means `one hour and five minutes ago`, while `now` means `now`.

## How to build from sources

We recommend using either [binary releases](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest) or
docker images ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/victoria-metrics/) and [Quay](https://quay.io/repository/victoriametrics/victoria-metrics?tab=tags)) instead of building VictoriaMetrics
from sources. Building from sources is reasonable when developing additional features specific
to your needs or when testing bugfixes.

### Development build

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).
1. Run `make victoria-metrics` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds `victoria-metrics` binary and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Production build

1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
1. Run `make victoria-metrics-prod` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds `victoria-metrics-prod` binary and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### ARM build

ARM build may run on Raspberry Pi or on [energy-efficient ARM servers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/arm-takes-wing/).

### Development ARM build

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).
1. Run `make victoria-metrics-linux-arm` or `make victoria-metrics-linux-arm64` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds `victoria-metrics-linux-arm` or `victoria-metrics-linux-arm64` binary respectively and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Production ARM build

1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
1. Run `make victoria-metrics-linux-arm-prod` or `make victoria-metrics-linux-arm64-prod` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds `victoria-metrics-linux-arm-prod` or `victoria-metrics-linux-arm64-prod` binary respectively and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Pure Go build (CGO_ENABLED=0)

`Pure Go` mode builds only Go code without [cgo](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/) dependencies.

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).
1. Run `make victoria-metrics-pure` from the root folder of [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
   It builds `victoria-metrics-pure` binary and puts it into the `bin` folder.

### Building docker images

Run `make package-victoria-metrics`. It builds `victoriametrics/victoria-metrics:<PKG_TAG>` docker image locally.
`<PKG_TAG>` is auto-generated image tag, which depends on source code in the repository.
The `<PKG_TAG>` may be manually set via `PKG_TAG=foobar make package-victoria-metrics`.

The base docker image is [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) but it is possible to use any other base image
by setting it via `<ROOT_IMAGE>` environment variable.
For example, the following command builds the image on top of [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) image:

```sh
ROOT_IMAGE=scratch make package-victoria-metrics
```

#### Building VictoriaMetrics with Podman

VictoriaMetrics can be built with Podman in either rootful or rootless mode.

When building via rootful Podman, simply add `DOCKER=podman` to the relevant `make` commandline.  To build
via rootless Podman, add `DOCKER=podman DOCKER_RUN="podman run --userns=keep-id"` to the `make`
commandline.

For example: `make victoria-metrics-pure DOCKER=podman DOCKER_RUN="podman run --userns=keep-id"`

Note that `production` builds are not supported via Podman because Podman does not support `buildx`.

## How to work with snapshots

### Create snapshot

Send a request to `http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/snapshot/create` endpoint in order to create
an [instant snapshot](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282).
The page returns the following JSON response on successful creation of snapshot:

```json
{"status":"ok","snapshot":"<snapshot-name>"}
```

Snapshots are created under `<-storageDataPath>/snapshots` directory, where `<-storageDataPath>`
is the corresponding command-line flag value. Snapshots can be archived to backup storage at any time
with [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackup/).

Snapshots consist of a mix of hard-links and soft-links to various files and directories inside `-storageDataPath`.
See [this article](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282)
for more details. This adds some restrictions on what can be done with the contents of `<-storageDataPath>/snapshots` directory:

* Do not delete subdirectories inside `<-storageDataPath>/snapshots` with `rm` or similar commands, since this will leave some snapshot data undeleted.
  Prefer using the `/snapshot/delete` API for deleting snapshot. See below for more details about this API.
* Do not copy subdirectories inside `<-storageDataPath>/snapshot` with `cp`, `rsync` or similar commands, since there are high chances
  that these commands won't copy some data stored in the snapshot. Prefer using [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackup/) for making copies of snapshot data.

See also [snapshot troubleshooting](#snapshot-troubleshooting).

The `http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/snapshot/list` endpoint returns the list of available snapshots.

### Delete snapshot

Send a query to `http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/snapshot/delete?snapshot=<snapshot-name>` in order
to delete the snapshot with `<snapshot-name>` name.

Navigate to `http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/snapshot/delete_all` in order to delete all the snapshots.

### How to restore from a snapshot

1. Stop VictoriaMetrics with `kill -INT`.
1. Restore snapshot contents from backup with [vmrestore](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmrestore/)
   to the directory pointed by `-storageDataPath`.
1. Start VictoriaMetrics.

### Snapshot troubleshooting

Snapshot doesn't occupy disk space just after its' creation thanks to the [used approach](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282).
Old snapshots may start occupying additional disk space if they refer to old parts, which were already deleted during [background merge](#storage).
That's why it is recommended deleting old snapshots after they are no longer needed in order to free up disk space used by old snapshots.
This can be done either manually or automatically if the `-snapshotsMaxAge` command-line flag is set. Make sure that the backup process has enough time to complete
when setting `-snapshotsMaxAge` command-line flag.

VictoriaMetrics exposes the current number of available snapshots via `vm_snapshots` metric at [`/metrics`](#monitoring) page.

## How to delete time series

Send a request to `http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series?match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_delete>`,
where `<timeseries_selector_for_delete>` may contain any [time series selector](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-series-selectors)
for metrics to delete. Delete API doesn't support the deletion of specific time ranges, the series can only be deleted completely.
Storage space for the deleted time series isn't freed instantly - it is freed during subsequent
[background merges of data files](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282).

Note that background merges may never occur for data from previous months, so storage space won't be freed for historical data.
In this case [forced merge](#forced-merge) may help freeing up storage space.

It is recommended verifying which metrics will be deleted with the call to `http://<victoria-metrics-addr>:8428/api/v1/series?match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_delete>`
before actually deleting the metrics. By default, this query will only scan series in the past 5 minutes, so you may need to
adjust `start` and `end` to a suitable range to achieve match hits. Also, if the number of returned time series is
rather big you will need to set `-search.maxDeleteSeries` flag (see [Resource usage limits](#resource-usage-limits)).

The `/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series` handler may be protected with `authKey` if `-deleteAuthKey` command-line flag is set.
Note that handler accepts any HTTP method, so sending a `GET` request to `/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series` will result in deletion of time series.

The delete API is intended mainly for the following cases:

* One-off deleting of accidentally written invalid (or undesired) time series.
* One-off deleting of user data due to [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation).

Using the delete API is not recommended in the following cases, since it brings a non-zero overhead:

* Regular cleanups for unneeded data. Just prevent writing unneeded data into VictoriaMetrics.
  This can be done with [relabeling](#relabeling).
  See [this article](https://www.robustperception.io/relabelling-can-discard-targets-timeseries-and-alerts) for details.
* Reducing disk space usage by deleting unneeded time series. This doesn't work as expected, since the deleted
  time series occupy disk space until the next merge operation, which can never occur when deleting too old data.
  [Forced merge](#forced-merge) may be used for freeing up disk space occupied by old data.
  Note that VictoriaMetrics doesn't delete entries from [IndexDB](#indexdb) for the deleted time series.
  IndexDB is cleaned up once per the configured [retention](#retention).

It's better to use the `-retentionPeriod` command-line flag for efficient pruning of old data.

## Forced merge

VictoriaMetrics performs [data compactions in background](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282)
in order to keep good performance characteristics when accepting new data. These compactions (merges) are performed independently on per-month partitions.
This means that compactions are stopped for per-month partitions if no new data is ingested into these partitions.
Sometimes it is necessary to trigger compactions for old partitions. For instance, in order to free up disk space occupied by [deleted time series](#how-to-delete-time-series).
In this case forced compaction may be initiated on the specified per-month partition by sending request to `/internal/force_merge?partition_prefix=YYYY_MM`,
where `YYYY_MM` is per-month partition name. For example, `http://victoriametrics:8428/internal/force_merge?partition_prefix=2020_08` would initiate forced
merge for August 2020 partition. The call to `/internal/force_merge` returns immediately, while the corresponding forced merge continues running in background.

Forced merges may require additional CPU, disk IO and storage space resources. It is unnecessary to run forced merge under normal conditions,
since VictoriaMetrics automatically performs [optimal merges in background](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282)
when new data is ingested into it.

## How to export time series

VictoriaMetrics provides the following handlers for exporting data:

* `/api/v1/export` for exporting data in JSON line format. See [these docs](#how-to-export-data-in-json-line-format) for details.
* `/api/v1/export/csv` for exporting data in CSV. See [these docs](#how-to-export-csv-data) for details.
* `/api/v1/export/native` for exporting data in native binary format. This is the most efficient format for data export.
  See [these docs](#how-to-export-data-in-native-format) for details.

### How to export data in JSON line format

Send a request to `http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/api/v1/export?match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_export>`,
where `<timeseries_selector_for_export>` may contain any [time series selector](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-series-selectors)
for metrics to export. Use `{__name__!=""}` selector for fetching all the time series.

The response would contain all the data for the selected time series in JSON line format - see [these docs](#json-line-format) for details on this format.

Each JSON line contains samples for a single time series. An example output:

```json
{"metric":{"__name__":"up","job":"node_exporter","instance":"localhost:9100"},"values":[0,0,0],"timestamps":[1549891472010,1549891487724,1549891503438]}
{"metric":{"__name__":"up","job":"prometheus","instance":"localhost:9090"},"values":[1,1,1],"timestamps":[1549891461511,1549891476511,1549891491511]}
```

Optional `start` and `end` args may be added to the request in order to limit the time frame for the exported data.
See [allowed formats](#timestamp-formats) for these args.

For example:

```sh
curl http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/api/v1/export -d 'match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_export>' -d 'start=1654543486' -d 'end=1654543486'
curl http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/api/v1/export -d 'match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_export>' -d 'start=2022-06-06T19:25:48' -d 'end=2022-06-06T19:29:07'
```

Optional `max_rows_per_line` arg may be added to the request for limiting the maximum number of rows exported per each JSON line.
Optional `reduce_mem_usage=1` arg may be added to the request for reducing memory usage when exporting big number of time series.
In this case the output may contain multiple lines with samples for the same time series.

Pass `Accept-Encoding: gzip` HTTP header in the request to `/api/v1/export` in order to reduce network bandwidth during exporting big amounts
of time series data. This enables gzip compression for the exported data. Example for exporting gzipped data:

```sh
curl -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' http://localhost:8428/api/v1/export -d 'match[]={__name__!=""}' > data.jsonl.gz
```

The maximum duration for each request to `/api/v1/export` is limited by `-search.maxExportDuration` command-line flag.

Exported data can be imported via POST'ing it to [/api/v1/import](#how-to-import-data-in-json-line-format).

By default, data exported via `/api/v1/export` is deduplicated according to [-dedup.minScrapeInterval](#deduplication) setting.
Pass GET param `reduce_mem_usage=1` in export request to disable deduplication for recently written data.
After [background merges](#storage) deduplication becomes permanent.

### How to export CSV data

Send a request to `http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/api/v1/export/csv?format=<format>&match=<timeseries_selector_for_export>`,
where:

* `<format>` must contain comma-delimited label names for the exported CSV. The following special label names are supported:
  * `__name__` - metric name
  * `__value__` - sample value
  * `__timestamp__:<ts_format>` - sample timestamp. `<ts_format>` can have the following values:
    * `unix_s` - unix seconds
    * `unix_ms` - unix milliseconds
    * `unix_ns` - unix nanoseconds
    * `rfc3339` - [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) time (in the timezone of the server)
    * `custom:<layout>` - custom layout for time that is supported by [time.Format](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format) function from Go.

* `<timeseries_selector_for_export>` may contain any [time series selector](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-series-selectors)
for metrics to export.

Optional `start` and `end` args may be added to the request in order to limit the time frame for the exported data.
See [allowed formats](#timestamp-formats) for these args.

For example:

```sh
curl http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/api/v1/export/csv -d 'format=<format>' -d 'match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_export>' -d 'start=1654543486' -d 'end=1654543486'
curl http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/api/v1/export/csv -d 'format=<format>' -d 'match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_export>' -d 'start=2022-06-06T19:25:48' -d 'end=2022-06-06T19:29:07'
```

The exported CSV data can be imported to VictoriaMetrics via [/api/v1/import/csv](#how-to-import-csv-data).

The [deduplication](#deduplication) is applied for the data exported in CSV by default. It is possible to export raw data without de-duplication by passing `reduce_mem_usage=1` query arg to `/api/v1/export/csv`.

### How to export data in native format

Send a request to `http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/api/v1/export/native?match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_export>`,
where `<timeseries_selector_for_export>` may contain any [time series selector](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-series-selectors)
for metrics to export. Use `{__name__=~".*"}` selector for fetching all the time series.

On large databases you may experience problems with limit on the number of time series, which can be exported. In this case you need to adjust `-search.maxExportSeries` command-line flag:

```sh
# count unique time series in database
wget -O- -q 'http://your_victoriametrics_instance:8428/api/v1/series/count' | jq '.data[0]'

# relaunch victoriametrics with search.maxExportSeries more than value from previous command
```

Optional `start` and `end` args may be added to the request in order to limit the time frame for the exported data.
See [allowed formats](#timestamp-formats) for these args.

For example:

```sh
curl http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/api/v1/export/native -d 'match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_export>' -d 'start=1654543486' -d 'end=1654543486'
curl http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/api/v1/export/native -d 'match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_export>' -d 'start=2022-06-06T19:25:48' -d 'end=2022-06-06T19:29:07'
```

The exported data can be imported to VictoriaMetrics via [/api/v1/import/native](#how-to-import-data-in-native-format).
The native export format may change in incompatible way between VictoriaMetrics releases, so the data exported from the release X
can fail to be imported into VictoriaMetrics release Y.

The [deduplication](#deduplication) isn't applied for the data exported in native format. It is expected that the de-duplication is performed during data import.

## How to import time series data

VictoriaMetrics can discover and scrape metrics from Prometheus-compatible targets (aka "pull" protocol) -
see [these docs](#how-to-scrape-prometheus-exporters-such-as-node-exporter).
Additionally, VictoriaMetrics can accept metrics via the following popular data ingestion protocols (aka "push" protocols):

* [Prometheus remote_write API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/prometheus/) for details.
* DataDog `submit metrics` API. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/datadog/) for details.
* InfluxDB line protocol. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/influxdb/#influxdb-compatible-agents-such-as-telegraf) for details.
* Graphite plaintext protocol. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/graphite/#ingesting) for details.
* OpenTelemetry http API. See [these docs](#sending-data-via-opentelemetry) for details.
* OpenTSDB telnet put protocol. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/opentsdb/#sending-data-via-telnet) for details.
* OpenTSDB http `/api/put` protocol. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/opentsdb/#sending-data-via-http) for details.
* `/api/v1/import` for importing data obtained from [/api/v1/export](#how-to-export-data-in-json-line-format).
  See [these docs](#how-to-import-data-in-json-line-format) for details.
* `/api/v1/import/native` for importing data obtained from [/api/v1/export/native](#how-to-export-data-in-native-format).
  See [these docs](#how-to-import-data-in-native-format) for details.
* `/api/v1/import/csv` for importing arbitrary CSV data. See [these docs](#how-to-import-csv-data) for details.
* `/api/v1/import/prometheus` for importing data in Prometheus exposition format and in [Pushgateway format](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway#url).
  See [these docs](#how-to-import-data-in-prometheus-exposition-format) for details.

Please note, most of the ingestion APIs (except [Prometheus remote_write API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write), [OpenTelemetry](#sending-data-via-opentelemetry) and [Influx Line Protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/influxdb/#influxdb-compatible-agents-such-as-telegraf))
are optimized for performance and processes data in a streaming fashion.
It means that client can transfer unlimited amount of data through the open connection. Because of this, import APIs
may not return parsing errors to the client, as it is expected for data stream to be not interrupted.
Instead, look for parsing errors on the server side (VictoriaMetrics single-node or vminsert) or
check for changes in `vm_rows_invalid_total` (exported by server side) metric.

### How to import data in JSON line format

VictoriaMetrics accepts metrics data in JSON line format at `/api/v1/import` endpoint. See [these docs](#json-line-format) for details on this format.

Example for importing data obtained via [/api/v1/export](#how-to-export-data-in-json-line-format):

```sh
# Export the data from <source-victoriametrics>:
curl http://source-victoriametrics:8428/api/v1/export -d 'match={__name__!=""}' > exported_data.jsonl

# Import the data to <destination-victoriametrics>:
curl -X POST http://destination-victoriametrics:8428/api/v1/import -T exported_data.jsonl
```

Pass `Content-Encoding: gzip` HTTP request header to `/api/v1/import` for importing gzipped data:

```sh
# Export gzipped data from <source-victoriametrics>:
curl -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' http://source-victoriametrics:8428/api/v1/export -d 'match={__name__!=""}' > exported_data.jsonl.gz

# Import gzipped data to <destination-victoriametrics>:
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Encoding: gzip' http://destination-victoriametrics:8428/api/v1/import -T exported_data.jsonl.gz
```

Extra labels may be added to all the imported time series by passing `extra_label=name=value` query args.
For example, `/api/v1/import?extra_label=foo=bar` would add `"foo":"bar"` label to all the imported time series.

Note that it could be required to flush response cache after importing historical data. See [these docs](#backfilling) for detail.

VictoriaMetrics parses input JSON lines one-by-one. It loads the whole JSON line in memory, then parses it and then saves the parsed samples into persistent storage.
This means that VictoriaMetrics can occupy big amounts of RAM when importing too long JSON lines.
The solution is to split too long JSON lines into shorter lines. It is OK if samples for a single time series are split among multiple JSON lines.
JSON line length can be limited via `max_rows_per_line` query arg when exporting via [/api/v1/export](#how-to-export-data-in-json-line-format).

The maximum JSON line length, which can be parsed by VictoriaMetrics, is limited by `-import.maxLineLen` command-line flag value.

### How to import data in native format

The specification of VictoriaMetrics' native format may yet change and is not formally documented yet. So currently we do not recommend that external clients attempt to pack their own metrics in native format file.

If you have a native format file obtained via [/api/v1/export/native](#how-to-export-data-in-native-format) however this is the most efficient protocol for importing data in.

```sh
# Export the data from <source-victoriametrics>:
curl http://source-victoriametrics:8428/api/v1/export/native -d 'match={__name__!=""}' > exported_data.bin

# Import the data to <destination-victoriametrics>:
curl -X POST http://destination-victoriametrics:8428/api/v1/import/native -T exported_data.bin
```

Extra labels may be added to all the imported time series by passing `extra_label=name=value` query args.
For example, `/api/v1/import/native?extra_label=foo=bar` would add `"foo":"bar"` label to all the imported time series.

Note that it could be required to flush response cache after importing historical data. See [these docs](#backfilling) for detail.

### How to import CSV data

Arbitrary CSV data can be imported via `/api/v1/import/csv`. The CSV data is imported according to the provided `format` query arg.
The `format` query arg must contain comma-separated list of parsing rules for CSV fields. Each rule consists of three parts delimited by a colon:

```text
<column_pos>:<type>:<context>
```

* `<column_pos>` is the position of the CSV column (field). Column numbering starts from 1. The order of parsing rules may be arbitrary.
* `<type>` describes the column type. Supported types are:
  * `metric` - the corresponding CSV column at `<column_pos>` contains metric value, which must be integer or floating-point number.
    The metric name is read from the `<context>`. CSV line must have at least a single metric field. Multiple metric fields per CSV line is OK.
  * `label` - the corresponding CSV column at `<column_pos>` contains label value. The label name is read from the `<context>`.
    CSV line may have arbitrary number of label fields. All these labels are attached to all the configured metrics.
  * `time` - the corresponding CSV column at `<column_pos>` contains metric time. CSV line may contain either one or zero columns with time.
    If CSV line has no time, then the current time is used. The time is applied to all the configured metrics.
    The format of the time is configured via `<context>`. Supported time formats are:
    * `unix_s` - unix timestamp in seconds.
    * `unix_ms` - unix timestamp in milliseconds.
    * `unix_ns` - unix timestamp in nanoseconds. Note that VictoriaMetrics rounds the timestamp to milliseconds.
    * `rfc3339` - timestamp in [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format, i.e. `2006-01-02T15:04:05Z`.
    * `custom:<layout>` - custom layout for the timestamp. The `<layout>` may contain arbitrary time layout according to [time.Parse rules in Go](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Parse).

Each request to `/api/v1/import/csv` may contain arbitrary number of CSV lines.

Example for importing CSV data via `/api/v1/import/csv`:

```sh
# Import via POST data:
curl -d "GOOG,1.23,4.56,NYSE" 'http://localhost:8428/api/v1/import/csv?format=2:metric:ask,3:metric:bid,1:label:ticker,4:label:market'
curl -d "MSFT,3.21,1.67,NASDAQ" 'http://localhost:8428/api/v1/import/csv?format=2:metric:ask,3:metric:bid,1:label:ticker,4:label:market'

# Import via file upload:
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8428/api/v1/import/csv?format=2:metric:ask,3:metric:bid,1:label:ticker,4:label:market' -T exported_data.csv
```

After that the data may be read via [/api/v1/export](#how-to-export-data-in-json-line-format) endpoint:

```sh
curl -G 'http://localhost:8428/api/v1/export' -d 'match[]={ticker!=""}'
```

The following response should be returned:

```json
{"metric":{"__name__":"bid","market":"NASDAQ","ticker":"MSFT"},"values":[1.67],"timestamps":[1583865146520]}
{"metric":{"__name__":"bid","market":"NYSE","ticker":"GOOG"},"values":[4.56],"timestamps":[1583865146495]}
{"metric":{"__name__":"ask","market":"NASDAQ","ticker":"MSFT"},"values":[3.21],"timestamps":[1583865146520]}
{"metric":{"__name__":"ask","market":"NYSE","ticker":"GOOG"},"values":[1.23],"timestamps":[1583865146495]}
```

Extra labels may be added to all the imported lines by passing `extra_label=name=value` query args.
For example, `/api/v1/import/csv?extra_label=foo=bar` would add `"foo":"bar"` label to all the imported lines.

Note that it could be required to flush response cache after importing historical data. See [these docs](#backfilling) for detail.

### How to import data in Prometheus exposition format

VictoriaMetrics accepts data in [Prometheus exposition format](https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/main/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats.md),
in [OpenMetrics format](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/master/specification/OpenMetrics.md)
and in [Pushgateway format](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway#url) via `/api/v1/import/prometheus` path.

For example, the following command imports a single line in Prometheus exposition format into VictoriaMetrics:

```sh
curl -d 'foo{bar="baz"} 123' -X POST 'http://localhost:8428/api/v1/import/prometheus'
```

The following command may be used for verifying the imported data:

```sh
curl -G 'http://localhost:8428/api/v1/export' -d 'match={__name__=~"foo"}'
```

It should return something like the following:

```json
{"metric":{"__name__":"foo","bar":"baz"},"values":[123],"timestamps":[1594370496905]}
```

The following command imports a single metric via [Pushgateway format](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway#url) with `{job="my_app",instance="host123"}` labels:

```sh
curl -d 'metric{label="abc"} 123' -X POST 'http://localhost:8428/api/v1/import/prometheus/metrics/job/my_app/instance/host123'
```

Pass `Content-Encoding: gzip` HTTP request header to `/api/v1/import/prometheus` for importing gzipped data:

```sh
# Import gzipped data to <destination-victoriametrics>:
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Encoding: gzip' http://destination-victoriametrics:8428/api/v1/import/prometheus -T prometheus_data.gz
```

Extra labels may be added to all the imported metrics either via [Pushgateway format](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway#url)
or by passing `extra_label=name=value` query args. For example, `/api/v1/import/prometheus?extra_label=foo=bar` would add `{foo="bar"}` label to all the imported metrics.

If timestamp is missing in `<metric> <value> <timestamp>` Prometheus exposition format line, then the current timestamp is used during data ingestion.
It can be overridden by passing unix timestamp in *milliseconds* via `timestamp` query arg. For example, `/api/v1/import/prometheus?timestamp=1594370496905`.

VictoriaMetrics accepts arbitrary number of lines in a single request to `/api/v1/import/prometheus`, i.e. it supports data streaming.

Note that it could be required to flush response cache after importing historical data. See [these docs](#backfilling) for detail.

VictoriaMetrics also may scrape Prometheus targets - see [these docs](#how-to-scrape-prometheus-exporters-such-as-node-exporter).

### Sending data via OpenTelemetry

VictoriaMetrics supports data ingestion via [OpenTelemetry protocol for metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/ffddc289462dfe0c2041e3ca42a7b1df805706de/specification/metrics/data-model.md) at `/opentelemetry/v1/metrics` path.

VictoriaMetrics expects `protobuf`-encoded requests at `/opentelemetry/v1/metrics`.
Set HTTP request header `Content-Encoding: gzip` when sending gzip-compressed data to `/opentelemetry/v1/metrics`.

VictoriaMetrics supports only [cumulative temporality](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#temporality)
for received measurements. The number of dropped unsupported samples is exposed via `vm_protoparser_rows_dropped_total{type="opentelemetry"` metric.

VictoriaMetrics stores the ingested OpenTelemetry [raw samples](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#raw-samples) as is without any transformations.
Pass `-opentelemetry.usePrometheusNaming` command-line flag to VictoriaMetrics for automatic conversion of metric names and labels into Prometheus-compatible format.
OpenTelemetry [exponential histogram](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#exponentialhistogram) is automatically converted
to [VictoriaMetrics histogram format](https://valyala.medium.com/improving-histogram-usability-for-prometheus-and-grafana-bc7e5df0e350).

Using the following exporter configuration in the OpenTelemetry collector will allow you to send metrics into VictoriaMetrics:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlphttp/victoriametrics:
    compression: gzip
    encoding: proto
    endpoint: http://<collector/vmagent>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:<port>/opentelemetry
```

> Note, [cluster version of VM](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#url-format) expects specifying tenant ID, i.e. `http://<vminsert>:<port>/insert/<accountID>/opentelemetry`.
> See more about [multitenancy](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#multitenancy).

Remember to add the exporter to the desired service pipeline in order to activate the exporter.

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      exporters:
        - otlphttp/victoriametrics
      receivers:
        - otlp
```

See [How to use OpenTelemetry metrics with VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/guides/getting-started-with-opentelemetry/).

## JSON line format

VictoriaMetrics accepts data in JSON line format at [/api/v1/import](#how-to-import-data-in-json-line-format)
and exports data in this format at [/api/v1/export](#how-to-export-data-in-json-line-format).

The format follows [JSON streaming concept](https://jsonlines.org/), e.g. each line contains JSON object with metrics data in the following format:

```json
{
  // metric contains metric name plus labels for a particular time series
  "metric":{
    "__name__": "metric_name",  // <- this is metric name

    // Other labels for the time series

    "label1": "value1",
    "label2": "value2",
    ...
    "labelN": "valueN"
  },

  // values contains raw sample values for the given time series
  "values": [1, 2.345, -678],

  // timestamps contains raw sample UNIX timestamps in milliseconds for the given time series
  // every timestamp is associated with the value at the corresponding position
  "timestamps": [1549891472010,1549891487724,1549891503438]
}
```

Note that every JSON object must be written in a single line, e.g. all the newline chars must be removed from it.
[/api/v1/import](#how-to-import-data-in-json-line-format) handler doesn't accept JSON lines longer than the value
passed to `-import.maxLineLen` command-line flag (by default this is 10MB).

It is recommended passing 1K-10K samples per line for achieving the maximum data ingestion performance at [/api/v1/import](#how-to-import-data-in-json-line-format).
Too long JSON lines may increase RAM usage at VictoriaMetrics side.

[/api/v1/export](#how-to-export-data-in-json-line-format) handler accepts `max_rows_per_line` query arg, which allows limiting the number of samples per each exported line.

It is OK to split [raw samples](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#raw-samples)
for the same [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#time-series) across multiple lines.

The number of lines in the request to [/api/v1/import](#how-to-import-data-in-json-line-format) can be arbitrary - they are imported in streaming manner.

## Relabeling

VictoriaMetrics supports Prometheus-compatible relabeling for all the ingested metrics if `-relabelConfig` command-line flag points
to a file containing a list of [relabel_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config) entries.
The `-relabelConfig` also can point to http or https url. For example, `-relabelConfig=https://config-server/relabel_config.yml`.

The following docs can be useful in understanding the relabeling:

* [Cookbook for common relabeling tasks](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/relabeling/).
* [Relabeling tips and tricks](https://valyala.medium.com/how-to-use-relabeling-in-prometheus-and-victoriametrics-8b90fc22c4b2).

The `-relabelConfig` files can contain special placeholders in the form `%{ENV_VAR}`, which are replaced by the corresponding environment variable values.

Example contents for `-relabelConfig` file:

```yaml
# Add {cluster="dev"} label.
- target_label: cluster
  replacement: dev

# Drop the metric (or scrape target) with `{__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_init="true"}` label.
- action: drop
  source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_init]
  regex: true
```

VictoriaMetrics provides additional relabeling features such as Graphite-style relabeling.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/relabeling/) for more details.

The relabeling can be debugged at `http://victoriametrics:8428/metric-relabel-debug` page
or at our [public demo playground](https://play.victoriametrics.com/select/accounting/1/6a716b0f-38bc-4856-90ce-448fd713e3fe/prometheus/graph/#/relabeling).
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/relabeling/#relabel-debugging) for more details.

## Federation

VictoriaMetrics exports [Prometheus-compatible federation data](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/)
at `http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/federate?match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_federation>`.

Optional `start` and `end` args may be added to the request in order to scrape the last point for each selected time series on the `[start ... end]` interval.
See [allowed formats](#timestamp-formats) for these args.

For example:

```sh
curl http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/federate -d 'match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_export>' -d 'start=1654543486' -d 'end=1654543486'
curl http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/federate -d 'match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_export>' -d 'start=2022-06-06T19:25:48' -d 'end=2022-06-06T19:29:07'
```

By default, the last point on the interval `[now - max_lookback ... now]` is scraped for each time series. The default value for `max_lookback` is `5m` (5 minutes), but it can be overridden with `max_lookback` query arg.
For instance, `/federate?match[]=up&max_lookback=1h` would return last points on the `[now - 1h ... now]` interval. This may be useful for time series federation
with scrape intervals exceeding `5m`.

## Capacity planning

VictoriaMetrics uses lower amounts of CPU, RAM and storage space on production workloads compared to competing solutions (Prometheus, Thanos, Cortex, TimescaleDB, InfluxDB, QuestDB, M3DB) according to [our case studies](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/casestudies/).

VictoriaMetrics capacity scales linearly with the available resources. The needed amounts of CPU and RAM highly depends on the workload - the number of [active time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-an-active-time-series), series [churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-high-churn-rate), query types, query qps, etc. It is recommended setting up a test VictoriaMetrics for your production workload and iteratively scaling CPU and RAM resources until it becomes stable according to [troubleshooting docs](#troubleshooting). A single-node VictoriaMetrics works perfectly with the following production workload according to [our case studies](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/casestudies/):

* Ingestion rate: 1.5+ million samples per second
* Active time series: 50+ million
* Total time series: 5+ billion
* Time series churn rate: 150+ million of new series per day
* Total number of samples: 10+ trillion
* Queries: 200+ qps
* Query latency (99th percentile): 1 second

The needed storage space for the given retention (the retention is set via `-retentionPeriod` command-line flag) can be extrapolated from disk space usage in a test run. For example, if `-storageDataPath` directory size becomes 10GB after a day-long test run on a production workload, then it will need at least `10GB*100=1TB` of disk space for `-retentionPeriod=100d` (100-days retention period).

It is recommended leaving the following amounts of spare resources:

* 50% of free RAM for reducing the probability of OOM (out of memory) crashes and slowdowns during temporary spikes in workload.
* 50% of spare CPU for reducing the probability of slowdowns during temporary spikes in workload.
* At least [20% of free storage space](#storage) at the directory pointed by `-storageDataPath` command-line flag. See also `-storage.minFreeDiskSpaceBytes` command-line [flag description](#list-of-command-line-flags).

See also [resource usage limits docs](#resource-usage-limits).

## Resource usage limits

By default, VictoriaMetrics is tuned for an optimal resource usage under typical workloads. Some workloads may need fine-grained resource usage limits. In these cases the following command-line flags may be useful:

* `-maxIngestionRate` limits samples/second ingested. This may be useful when CPU resources are limited or overloaded.
* `-memory.allowedPercent` and `-memory.allowedBytes` limit the amounts of memory, which may be used for various internal caches at VictoriaMetrics.
  Note that VictoriaMetrics may use more memory, since these flags don't limit additional memory, which may be needed on a per-query basis.
* `-search.maxMemoryPerQuery` limits the amounts of memory, which can be used for processing a single query. Queries, which need more memory, are rejected.
  Heavy queries, which select big number of time series, may exceed the per-query memory limit by a small percent. The total memory limit
  for concurrently executed queries can be estimated as `-search.maxMemoryPerQuery` multiplied by `-search.maxConcurrentRequests`.
* `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` limits the number of unique time series a single query can find and process. By default, VictoriaMetrics calculates the limit automatically
  based on the available memory and the maximum number of concurrent requests it can process (see `-search.maxConcurrentRequests`). VictoriaMetrics keeps in memory
  some metainformation about the time series located by each query and spends some CPU time for processing the found time series.
  This means that the maximum memory usage and CPU usage a single query can use is proportional to `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries`.
* `-search.maxQueryDuration` limits the duration of a single query. If the query takes longer than the given duration, then it is canceled.
  This allows saving CPU and RAM when executing unexpected heavy queries.
  The limit can be overridden to a smaller value by passing `timeout` GET parameter.
* `-search.maxConcurrentRequests` limits the number of concurrent requests VictoriaMetrics can process. Bigger number of concurrent requests usually means
  bigger memory usage. For example, if a single query needs 100 MiB of additional memory during its execution, then 100 concurrent queries may need `100 * 100 MiB = 10 GiB`
  of additional memory. So it is better to limit the number of concurrent queries, while pausing additional incoming queries if the concurrency limit is reached.
  VictoriaMetrics provides `-search.maxQueueDuration` command-line flag for limiting the max wait time for paused queries. See also `-search.maxMemoryPerQuery` command-line flag.
* `-search.maxQueueDuration` limits the maximum duration queries may wait for execution when `-search.maxConcurrentRequests` concurrent queries are executed.
* `-search.ignoreExtraFiltersAtLabelsAPI` enables ignoring of `match[]`, [`extra_filters[]` and `extra_label`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#prometheus-querying-api-enhancements)
  query args at [/api/v1/labels](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1labels) and
  [/api/v1/label/.../values](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1labelvalues).
  This may be useful for reducing the load on VictoriaMetrics if the provided extra filters match too many time series.
  The downside is that the endpoints can return labels and series, which do not match the provided extra filters.
* `-search.maxSamplesPerSeries` limits the number of raw samples the query can process per each time series. VictoriaMetrics sequentially processes
  raw samples per each found time series during the query. It unpacks raw samples on the selected time range per each time series into memory
  and then applies the given [rollup function](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/metricsql/#rollup-functions). The `-search.maxSamplesPerSeries` command-line flag
  allows limiting memory usage in the case when the query is executed on a time range, which contains hundreds of millions of raw samples per each located time series.
* `-search.maxSamplesPerQuery` limits the number of raw samples a single query can process. This allows limiting CPU usage for heavy queries.
* `-search.maxResponseSeries` limits the number of time series a single query can return from [`/api/v1/query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#instant-query)
  and [`/api/v1/query_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#range-query).
* `-search.maxPointsPerTimeseries` limits the number of calculated points, which can be returned per each matching time series
  from [range query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#range-query).
* `-search.maxPointsSubqueryPerTimeseries` limits the number of calculated points, which can be generated per each matching time series
  during [subquery](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/metricsql/#subqueries) evaluation.
* `-search.maxSeriesPerAggrFunc` limits the number of time series, which can be generated by [MetricsQL aggregate functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/metricsql/#aggregate-functions)
  in a single query.
* `-search.maxSeries` limits the number of time series, which may be returned from [/api/v1/series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1series).
  This endpoint is used mostly by Grafana for auto-completion of metric names, label names and label values. Queries to this endpoint may take big amounts
  of CPU time and memory when the database contains big number of unique time series because of [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-high-churn-rate).
  In this case it might be useful to set the `-search.maxSeries` to quite low value in order limit CPU and memory usage.
  See also `-search.maxLabelsAPIDuration` and `-search.maxLabelsAPISeries`.
* `-search.maxDeleteSeries` limits the number of unique time series that can be
  deleted by a single
  [/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1admintsdbdelete_series)
  call. The duration is limited via `-search.maxDeleteDuration` flag{{% available_from "v1.110.0" %}}. Deleting too many time series may require big
  amount of CPU and memory and this limit guards against unplanned resource usage spikes. Also see
  [How to delete time series](#how-to-delete-time-series) section to learn about
  different ways of deleting series.
* `-search.maxTSDBStatusTopNSeries` at `vmselect` limits the number of unique time
  series that can be queried with topN argument by a single
  [/api/v1/status/tsdb?topN=N](#tsdb-stats)
  call.
* `-search.maxTagKeys` limits the number of items, which may be returned from [/api/v1/labels](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1labels).
  This endpoint is used mostly by Grafana for auto-completion of label names. Queries to this endpoint may take big amounts of CPU time and memory

  See also `-search.maxLabelsAPIDuration` and `-search.maxLabelsAPISeries`.

  See also `-search.maxLabelsAPIDuration` and `-search.maxLabelsAPISeries`.
* `-search.maxLabelsAPISeries` limits the number of time series, which can be scanned when performing [/api/v1/labels](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1labels) or
  [/api/v1/label/.../values](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1labelvalues) requests.

  See also `-search.maxLabelsAPIDuration` and `-search.ignoreExtraFiltersAtLabelsAPI`.
* `-search.maxLabelsAPIDuration` limits the duration for requests to [/api/v1/labels](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1labels),

## High availability

The general approach for achieving high availability is the following:

* To run two identically configured VictoriaMetrics instances in distinct datacenters (availability zones);
* To store the collected data simultaneously into these instances via [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/) or Prometheus.
* To query the first VictoriaMetrics instance and to fail over to the second instance when the first instance becomes temporarily unavailable.
  This can be done via [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#high-availability).

Such a setup guarantees that the collected data isn't lost when one of VictoriaMetrics instance becomes unavailable.
The collected data continues to be written to the available VictoriaMetrics instance, so it should be available for querying.
Both [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/) and Prometheus buffer the collected data locally if they cannot send it
to the configured remote storage. So the collected data will be written to the temporarily unavailable VictoriaMetrics instance
after it becomes available.

If you use [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/) for storing the data into VictoriaMetrics,
then it can be configured with multiple `-remoteWrite.url` command-line flags, where every flag points to the VictoriaMetrics
instance in a particular availability zone, in order to replicate the collected data to all the VictoriaMetrics instances.
For example, the following command instructs `vmagent` to replicate data to `vm-az1` and `vm-az2` instances of VictoriaMetrics:

```sh
/path/to/vmagent \
  -remoteWrite.url=http://<vm-az1>:8428/api/v1/write \
  -remoteWrite.url=http://<vm-az2>:8428/api/v1/write
```

If you use Prometheus for collecting and writing the data to VictoriaMetrics,
then the following [`remote_write`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write) section
in Prometheus config can be used for replicating the collected data to `vm-az1` and `vm-az2` VictoriaMetrics instances:

```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: http://<vm-az1>:8428/api/v1/write
  - url: http://<vm-az2>:8428/api/v1/write
```

It is recommended to use [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/) instead of Prometheus for highly loaded setups,
since it uses lower amounts of RAM, CPU and network bandwidth than Prometheus.

If you use identically configured [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/) instances for collecting the same data
and sending it to VictoriaMetrics, then do not forget enabling [deduplication](#deduplication) at VictoriaMetrics side.

See [victoria-metrics-distributed chart](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/helm/victoria-metrics-distributed/) for an example.

## Deduplication

VictoriaMetrics leaves a single [raw sample](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#raw-samples)
with the biggest [timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) for each [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#time-series)
per each `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` discrete interval if `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` is set to positive duration.
For example, `-dedup.minScrapeInterval=60s` would leave a single raw sample with the biggest timestamp per each discrete
`60s` interval.
This aligns with the [staleness rules in Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#staleness).

If multiple raw samples have **the same timestamp** on the given `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` discrete interval,
then the sample with **the biggest value** is kept.
[Stale markers](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/#prometheus-staleness-markers) are preferred over any other value.

[Prometheus staleness markers](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/#prometheus-staleness-markers) are processed as any other value during de-duplication.
If raw sample with the biggest timestamp on `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` contains a stale marker, then it is kept after the deduplication.
This allows properly preserving staleness markers during the de-duplication.

Please note, [labels](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#labels) of raw samples should be identical
in order to be deduplicated. For example, this is why [HA pair of vmagents](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/#high-availability)
needs to be identically configured.

The `-dedup.minScrapeInterval=D` is equivalent to `-downsampling.period=0s:D` in [downsampling](#downsampling).
It is also safe to use deduplication and downsampling simultaneously.

The recommended value for `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` must equal to `scrape_interval` config from Prometheus configs.
It is recommended to have a single `scrape_interval` across all the scrape targets.
See [this article](https://www.robustperception.io/keep-it-simple-scrape_interval-id) for details.

The de-duplication reduces disk space usage if multiple **identically configured** [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/)
or Prometheus instances in HA pair write data to the same VictoriaMetrics instance.
These vmagent or Prometheus instances must have **identical** `external_labels` section in their configs,
so they write data to the same time series.
See also [how to set up multiple vmagent instances for scraping the same targets](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/#scraping-big-number-of-targets).

It is recommended passing different `-promscrape.cluster.name` values to each distinct HA pair of `vmagent` instances,
so the de-duplication consistently leaves samples for one `vmagent` instance and removes duplicate samples
from other `vmagent` instances.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/#high-availability) for details.

VictoriaMetrics stores all the ingested samples to disk even if `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` command-line flag is set.
The ingested samples are de-duplicated during [background merges](#storage) and during query execution.
VictoriaMetrics also supports de-duplication during data ingestion before the data is stored to disk, via `-streamAggr.dedupInterval` command-line flag -
see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/stream-aggregation/#deduplication).

## Storage

VictoriaMetrics buffers the ingested data in memory for up to a second. Then the buffered data is written to in-memory `parts`,
which can be searched during queries. The in-memory `parts` are periodically persisted to disk, so they could survive unclean shutdown
such as out of memory crash, hardware power loss or `SIGKILL` signal. The interval for flushing the in-memory data to disk
can be configured with the `-inmemoryDataFlushInterval` command-line flag (note that too short flush interval may significantly increase disk IO).

In-memory parts are persisted to disk into `part` directories under the `<-storageDataPath>/data/small/YYYY_MM/` folder,
where `YYYY_MM` is the month partition for the stored data. For example, `2022_11` is the partition for `parts`
with [raw samples](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#raw-samples) from `November 2022`.
Each partition directory contains `parts.json` file with the actual list of parts in the partition.

Every `part` directory contains `metadata.json` file with the following fields:

* `RowsCount` - the number of [raw samples](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#raw-samples) stored in the part
* `BlocksCount` - the number of blocks stored in the part (see details about blocks below)
* `MinTimestamp` and `MaxTimestamp` - minimum and maximum timestamps across raw samples stored in the part
* `MinDedupInterval` - the [deduplication interval](#deduplication) applied to the given part.

Each `part` consists of `blocks` sorted by internal time series id (aka `TSID`).
Each `block` contains up to 8K [raw samples](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#raw-samples),
which belong to a single [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#time-series).
Raw samples in each block are sorted by `timestamp`. Blocks for the same time series are sorted
by the `timestamp` of the first sample. Timestamps and values for all the blocks
are stored in [compressed form](https://faun.pub/victoriametrics-achieving-better-compression-for-time-series-data-than-gorilla-317bc1f95932)
in separate files under `part` directory - `timestamps.bin` and `values.bin`.

The `part` directory also contains `index.bin` and `metaindex.bin` files - these files contain index
for fast block lookups, which belong to the given `TSID` and cover the given time range.

`Parts` are periodically merged into bigger parts in background. The background merge provides the following benefits:

* keeping the number of data files under control, so they don't exceed limits on open files
* improved data compression, since bigger parts are usually compressed better than smaller parts
* improved query speed, since queries over smaller number of parts are executed faster
* various background maintenance tasks such as [de-duplication](#deduplication), [downsampling](#downsampling)
  and [freeing up disk space for the deleted time series](#how-to-delete-time-series) are performed during the merge

Newly added `parts` either successfully appear in the storage or fail to appear.
The newly added `part` is atomically registered in the `parts.json` file under the corresponding partition
after it is fully written and [fsynced](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fsync.2.html) to the storage.
Thanks to this algorithm, storage never contains partially created parts, even if hardware power off
occurs in the middle of writing the `part` to disk - such incompletely written `parts`
are automatically deleted on the next VictoriaMetrics start.

The same applies to merge process — `parts` are either fully merged into a new `part` or fail to merge,
leaving the source `parts` untouched. However, due to hardware issues data on disk may be corrupted regardless of
VictoriaMetrics process. VictoriaMetrics can detect corruption during decompressing, decoding or sanity checking
of the data blocks. But **it cannot fix the corrupted data**. Data parts that fail to load on startup need to be deleted
or restored from backups. This is why it is recommended performing
[regular backups](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#backups).

VictoriaMetrics doesn't use checksums for stored data blocks. See why in this [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3011).

VictoriaMetrics doesn't merge parts if their summary size exceeds free disk space.
This prevents from potential out of disk space errors during merge.
The number of parts may significantly increase over time under free disk space shortage.
This increases overhead during data querying, since VictoriaMetrics needs to read data from
bigger number of parts per each request. That's why it is recommended to have at least 20%
of free disk space under directory pointed by `-storageDataPath` command-line flag.

Information about merging process is available in [the dashboard for single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10229)
and [the dashboard for VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176).

## IndexDB

VictoriaMetrics identifies
[time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#time-series) by
`TSID` (time series ID) and stores
[raw samples](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#raw-samples) sorted
by TSID (see [Storage](#storage)). Thus, the TSID is a primary index and could
be used for searching and retrieving raw samples. However, the TSID is never
exposed to the clients, i.e. it is for internal use only.

Instead, VictoriaMetrics maintains an **inverted index** that enables searching
the raw samples by metric name, label name, and label value by mapping these
values to the corresponding TSIDs.

VictoriaMetrics uses two types of inverted indexes:

* Global index. Searches using this index is performed across the entire
    retention period.
* Per-day index. This index stores mappings similar to ones in global index
    but also includes the date in each mapping. This speeds up data retrieval
    for queries within a shorter time range (which is often just the last day).

When the search query is executed, VictoriaMetrics decides which index to use
based on the time range of the query:

* Per-day index is used if the search time range is 40 days or less.
* Global index is used for search queries with a time range greater than 40
    days.

Mappings are added to the indexes during the data ingestion:

* In global index each mapping is created only once per retention period.
* In the per-day index each mapping is created for each unique date that
    has been seen in the samples for the corresponding time series.

IndexDB respects [retention period](#retention) and once it is over, the indexes
are dropped. For the new retention period, the indexes are gradually populated
again as the new samples arrive.

### Index tuning for low churn rate

By default, VictoriaMetrics uses the following indexes for data retrieval: `global` and `per-day`.
Both store the same data and on query time VictoriaMetrics can choose between indexes for optimal performance.
See [IndexDB](#indexdb) for details.

If your use case involves [high cardinality](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-high-cardinality)
with [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-high-churn-rate)
then this default setting should be ideal for you.

A prominent example is Kubernetes. Services in k8s expose big number of series with short lifetime, significantly
increasing churn rate. The per-day index speeds up data retrieval in this case.

But if your use case assumes low or no churn rate, then you might benefit from disabling the per-day index by setting
the flag `-disablePerDayIndex`{{% available_from "v1.112.0" %}}. This will improve the time series ingestion speed and decrease disk space usage,
since no time or disk space is spent maintaining the per-day index.

Example use cases:

* Historical weather data, such as [ERA5](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview).
  It consists of millions time series whose hourly values span tens of years. The time series set never changes.
  If the per-day index is disabled, once the first hour of data is ingested the entire time series set will be written
  into the global index and subsequent portions of data will not result in index update. But if the per-day index
  is enabled, the same set of time-series will be written to the per-day index for every day of data.

* IoT: a huge set of sensors exports time series with the sensor ID used as a metric label value. Since sensor additions
  or removals happen infrequently, the time series churn rate will be low. With the per-day index disabled, the entire
  time series set will be registered in global index during the initial data ingestion and the global index will receive
  small updates when a sensor is added or removed.

What to expect:

* Prefer setting this flag on fresh installations.
* Disabling per-day index on installations with historical data is Ok.
* Re-enabling per-day index on installations with historical data will make it unsearchable.

## Retention

Retention is configured with the `-retentionPeriod` command-line flag, which takes a number followed by a time unit
character - `h(ours)`, `d(ays)`, `w(eeks)`, `y(ears)`. If the time unit is not specified, a month (31 days) is assumed.
For instance, `-retentionPeriod=3` means that the data will be stored for 3 months (93 days) and then deleted.
The default retention period is one month. The **minimum retention** period is 24h or 1d.

Data is split in per-month partitions inside `<-storageDataPath>/data/{small,big}` folders.
**Data partitions** outside the configured retention are deleted **on the first day of the new month**.
Each partition consists of one or more **data parts**. Data parts outside the configured retention
are **eventually deleted** during [background merge](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282).
The time range covered by data part is **not limited by retention period unit**. One data part can cover hours or days of
data. Hence, a data part can be deleted only **when fully outside the configured retention**.
See more about partitions and parts in the [Storage section](#storage).

The maximum disk space usage for a given `-retentionPeriod` is going to be (`-retentionPeriod` + 1) months.
For example, if `-retentionPeriod` is set to 1, data for January is deleted on March 1st.

It is safe to extend `-retentionPeriod` on existing data. If `-retentionPeriod` is set to a lower
value than before, then data outside the configured period will be eventually deleted.

VictoriaMetrics does not support indefinite retention, but you can specify an arbitrarily high duration, e.g. `-retentionPeriod=100y`.

### Multiple retentions

Distinct retentions for distinct time series can be configured via [retention filters](#retention-filters)
in [VictoriaMetrics Enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/).

Community version of VictoriaMetrics supports only a single retention, which can be configured via [-retentionPeriod](#retention) command-line flag.
If you need multiple retentions in community version of VictoriaMetrics, then you may start multiple VictoriaMetrics instances with distinct values for the following flags:

* `-retentionPeriod`
* `-storageDataPath`, so the data for each retention period is saved in a separate directory
* `-httpListenAddr`, so clients may reach VictoriaMetrics instance with proper retention

Then set up [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) in front of VictoriaMetrics instances,
so it could route requests from particular user to VictoriaMetrics with the desired retention.

Similar scheme can be applied for multiple tenants in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/).
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/guides/guide-vmcluster-multiple-retention-setup/) for multi-retention setup details.

### Retention filters

[Enterprise version of VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) supports `retention filters`,
which allow configuring multiple retentions for distinct sets of time series matching the configured [series filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#filtering)
via `-retentionFilter` command-line flag. This flag accepts `filter:duration` options, where `filter` must be
a valid [series filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#filtering), while the `duration`
must contain valid [retention](#retention) for time series matching the given `filter`.
The `duration` of the `-retentionFilter` must be lower or equal to [-retentionPeriod](#retention) flag value.
If series doesn't match any configured `-retentionFilter`, then the retention configured via [-retentionPeriod](#retention)
command-line flag is applied to it. If series matches multiple configured retention filters, then the smallest retention is applied.

For example, the following config sets 3 days retention for time series with `team="juniors"` label,
30 days retention for time series with `env="dev"` or `env="staging"` label and 1 year retention for the remaining time series:

```sh
-retentionFilter='{team="juniors"}:3d' -retentionFilter='{env=~"dev|staging"}:30d' -retentionPeriod=1y
```

There are two gauge metrics to monitor the retention filters process:

* `vm_retention_filters_partitions_scheduled` shows the total number of partitions scheduled for retention filters
* `vm_retention_filters_partitions_scheduled_size_bytes` shows the total size of scheduled partitions.

Additionally, a log message with the filter expression and the partition name is written to the log on the start and completion of the operation.

Important notes:

* The data outside the configured retention isn't deleted instantly - it is deleted eventually during [background merges](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#storage).
* The `-retentionFilter` doesn't remove old data from [IndexDB](#indexdb) until the configured [-retentionPeriod](#retention).
  So the IndexDB size can grow big under [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-high-churn-rate)
  even for small retentions configured via `-retentionFilter`.

Retention filters configuration can be tested in enterprise version of vmui on the page `Tools.Retention filters debug`.
It is safe updating `-retentionFilter` during VictoriaMetrics restarts - the updated retention filters are applied eventually
to historical data.

It's expected that resource usage will temporarily increase when `-retentionFilter` is applied.
This is because additional operations are required to read the data, filter and apply retention to partitions,
which will cost extra CPU and memory.

See [how to configure multiple retentions in VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#retention-filters).

See also [downsampling](#downsampling).

Retention filters can be evaluated for free by downloading and using enterprise binaries from [the releases page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest).
See how to request a [free trial license](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/trial/).

## Downsampling

[VictoriaMetrics Enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) supports multi-level downsampling via `-downsampling.period=offset:interval` command-line flag.
This command-line flag instructs leaving the last sample per each `interval` for [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#time-series)
[samples](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#raw-samples) older than the `offset`. The `offset` must be a multiple of `interval`. For example, `-downsampling.period=30d:5m` instructs leaving the last sample
per each 5-minute interval for samples older than 30 days, while the rest of samples are dropped.

The `-downsampling.period` command-line flag can be specified multiple times in order to apply different downsampling levels for different time ranges (aka multi-level downsampling).
For example, `-downsampling.period=30d:5m,180d:1h` instructs leaving the last sample per each 5-minute interval for samples older than 30 days,
while leaving the last sample per each 1-hour interval for samples older than 180 days.

VictoriaMetrics supports{{% available_from "v1.100.0" %}} configuring independent downsampling per different sets of [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#time-series)
via `-downsampling.period=filter:offset:interval` syntax. In this case the given `offset:interval` downsampling is applied only to time series matching the given `filter`.
The `filter` can contain arbitrary [series filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#filtering).
For example, `-downsampling.period='{__name__=~"(node|process)_.*"}:1d:1m` instructs VictoriaMetrics to downsample samples older than one day with one minute interval
only for [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#time-series) with names starting with `node_` or `process_` prefixes.
The downsampling for other time series can be configured independently via additional `-downsampling.period` command-line flags.
Downsampling configuration can be tested in enterprise version of vmui on the page `Tools.Downsampling filters debug`.

If the time series doesn't match any `filter`, then it isn't downsampled. If the time series matches multiple filters, then the downsampling
for the first matching `filter` is applied. For example, `-downsampling.period='{env="prod"}:1d:30s,{__name__=~"node_.*"}:1d:5m'` de-duplicates
samples older than one day with 30 seconds interval across all the time series with `env="prod"` [label](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#labels),
even if their names start with `node_` prefix. All the other time series with names starting with `node_` prefix are de-duplicated with 5 minutes interval.

If downsampling shouldn't be applied to some time series matching the given `filter`, then pass `-downsampling.period=filter:0s:0s` command-line flag to VictoriaMetrics.
For example, if series with `env="prod"` label shouldn't be downsampled, then pass `-downsampling.period='{env="prod"}:0s:0s'` command-line flag in front of other `-downsampling.period` flags.
But `-downsampling.period=0s:interval` or `-downsampling.period=filter:0s:0s` cannot be used with [deduplication](#deduplication) simultaneously as they could conflict.

Downsampling is applied independently per each time series and leaves a single [raw sample](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#raw-samples)
with the biggest [timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) on the configured interval, in the same way as [deduplication](#deduplication) does.
It works the best for [counters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#counter) and [histograms](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#histogram),
as their values are always increasing. Downsampling [gauges](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#gauge)
and [summaries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#summary) lose some changes within the downsampling interval,
since only the last sample on the given interval is left and the rest of samples are dropped.

You can use [recording rules](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#rules) or [streaming aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/stream-aggregation/)
to apply custom aggregation functions, like min/max/avg etc., in order to make gauges more resilient to downsampling.

Downsampling can reduce disk space usage and improve query performance if it is applied to time series with big number
of samples per each series. The downsampling doesn't improve query performance and doesn't reduce disk space if the database contains big number
of time series with small number of samples per each series, since downsampling doesn't reduce the number of time series.
So there is little sense in applying downsampling to time series with [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-high-churn-rate).
In this case the majority of query time is spent on searching for the matching time series instead of processing the found samples.
It is possible to use [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/stream-aggregation/) in [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/)
or [recording rules in vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#rules) in order to
[reduce the number of time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#downsampling-and-aggregation-via-vmalert).

Downsampling is performed during [background merges](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#storage).
It cannot be performed if there is not enough of free disk space or if vmstorage is in [read-only mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#readonly-mode).

It's expected that resource usage will temporarily increase when **downsampling with filters** is applied.
This is because additional operations are required to read historical data, downsample, and persist it back,
which will cost extra CPU and memory.

Please, note that intervals of `-downsampling.period` for a single filter must be multiples of each other.
In case [deduplication](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#deduplication) is enabled, value of `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` command-line flag must also
be multiple of `-downsampling.period` intervals. This is required to ensure consistency of deduplication and downsampling results.

It is safe updating `-downsampling.period` during VictoriaMetrics restarts - the updated downsampling configuration will be
applied eventually to historical data during  [background merges](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#storage).

See [how to configure downsampling in VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#downsampling).

See also [retention filters](#retention-filters).

The downsampling can be evaluated for free by downloading and using enterprise binaries from [the releases page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest).
See how to request a [free trial license](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/trial/).

## Multi-tenancy

Single-node VictoriaMetrics doesn't support multi-tenancy. Use the [cluster version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#multitenancy) instead.

## Scalability and cluster version

Though single-node VictoriaMetrics cannot scale to multiple nodes, it is optimized for resource usage - storage size / bandwidth / IOPS, RAM, CPU.
This means that a single-node VictoriaMetrics may scale vertically and substitute a moderately sized cluster built with competing solutions
such as Thanos, Uber M3, InfluxDB or TimescaleDB. See [vertical scalability benchmarks](https://medium.com/@valyala/measuring-vertical-scalability-for-time-series-databases-in-google-cloud-92550d78d8ae).

So try single-node VictoriaMetrics at first and then [switch to the cluster version](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/cluster) if you still need
horizontally scalable long-term remote storage for really large Prometheus deployments.
[Contact us](mailto:info@victoriametrics.com) for enterprise support.

## Alerting

It is recommended using [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/) for alerting.

Additionally, alerting can be set up with the following tools:

* With Prometheus - see [the corresponding docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/overview/).
* With Promxy - see [the corresponding docs](https://github.com/jacksontj/promxy/blob/master/README.md#how-do-i-use-alertingrecording-rules-in-promxy).
* With Grafana - see [the corresponding docs](https://grafana.com/docs/alerting/rules/).

## Security

General security recommendations:

* All the VictoriaMetrics components must run in protected private networks without direct access from untrusted networks such as Internet.
  The exception is [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) and [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmgateway/),
  which are intended for serving public requests and performing authorization with [TLS termination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy).
* All the requests from untrusted networks to VictoriaMetrics components must go through auth proxy such as [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/)
  or [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmgateway/). The proxy must be set up with proper authentication and authorization.
* Prefer using lists of allowed API endpoints, while disallowing access to other endpoints when configuring [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/)
  in front of VictoriaMetrics components.
* Set reasonable [`Strict-Transport-Security`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) header value to all the components to mitigate [MitM attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack), for example: `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`. See `-http.header.hsts` flag.
* Set reasonable [`Content-Security-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) header value to mitigate [XSS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting). See `-http.header.csp` flag.
* Set reasonable [`X-Frame-Options`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) header value to mitigate [clickjacking attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking), for example `DENY`. See `-http.header.frameOptions` flag.

VictoriaMetrics provides the following security-related command-line flags:

* `-tls`, `-tlsCertFile` and `-tlsKeyFile` for switching from HTTP to HTTPS at `-httpListenAddr` (TCP port 8428 is listened by default).
  [Enterprise version of VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) supports automatic issuing of TLS certificates.
  See [these docs](#automatic-issuing-of-tls-certificates).
* `-mtls` and `-mtlsCAFile` for enabling [mTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication) for requests to `-httpListenAddr`. See [these docs](#mtls-protection).
* `-httpAuth.username` and `-httpAuth.password` for protecting all the HTTP endpoints
  with [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
* `-deleteAuthKey` for protecting `/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series` endpoint. See [how to delete time series](#how-to-delete-time-series).
* `-snapshotAuthKey` for protecting `/snapshot*` endpoints. See [how to work with snapshots](#how-to-work-with-snapshots).
* `-forceFlushAuthKey` for protecting `/internal/force_flush` endpoint. See [these docs](#troubleshooting).
* `-forceMergeAuthKey` for protecting `/internal/force_merge` endpoint. See [force merge docs](#forced-merge).
* `-search.resetCacheAuthKey` for protecting `/internal/resetRollupResultCache` endpoint. See [backfilling](#backfilling) for more details.
* `-reloadAuthKey` for protecting `/-/reload` endpoint, which is used for force reloading of [`-promscrape.config`](#how-to-scrape-prometheus-exporters-such-as-node-exporter).
* `-configAuthKey` for protecting `/config` endpoint, since it may contain sensitive information such as passwords.
* `-flagsAuthKey` for protecting `/flags` endpoint.
* `-pprofAuthKey` for protecting `/debug/pprof/*` endpoints, which can be used for [profiling](#profiling).
* `-metricNamesStatsResetAuthKey` for protecting `/api/v1/admin/status/metric_names_stats/reset` endpoint, used for [Metric Names Tracker](#track-ingested-metrics-usage).
* `-denyQueryTracing` for disallowing [query tracing](#query-tracing).
* `-http.header.hsts`, `-http.header.csp`, and `-http.header.frameOptions` for serving `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Content-Security-Policy`
  and `X-Frame-Options` HTTP response headers.

Explicitly set internal network interface for TCP and UDP ports for data ingestion with Graphite and OpenTSDB formats.
For example, substitute `-graphiteListenAddr=:2003` with `-graphiteListenAddr=<internal_iface_ip>:2003`. This protects from unexpected requests from untrusted network interfaces.

See also [security recommendation for VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#security)
and [the general security page at VictoriaMetrics website](https://victoriametrics.com/security/).

### CVE handling policy

**Source code:** Go dependencies are scanned by [govulncheck](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck) in CI. 
All vulnerabilities must be fixed before next scheduled release and backported to [LTS releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/lts-releases/).

**Docker images:** CVE findings in [Alpine](https://security.alpinelinux.org/) base image pose minimal risk since VictoriaMetrics binaries are statically compiled with no OS dependencies.
When detected, only the Alpine base tag is updated.
Releases proceed as planned even if upstream fixes are not yet available.
For maximum security, hardened [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch)-based images are also provided.
All images are continuously scanned by Docker Hub and verified before release using [grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype).

### mTLS protection

By default `VictoriaMetrics` accepts http requests at `8428` port (this port can be changed via `-httpListenAddr` command-line flags).
[Enterprise version of VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) supports the ability to accept [mTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication)
requests at this port, by specifying `-tls` and `-mtls` command-line flags. For example, the following command runs `VictoriaMetrics`, which accepts only mTLS requests at port `8428`:

```sh
./victoria-metrics -tls -mtls
```

By default, system-wide [TLS Root CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate) is used for verifying client certificates if `-mtls` command-line flag is specified.
It is possible to specify custom TLS Root CA via `-mtlsCAFile` command-line flag.

### Automatic issuing of TLS certificates

All the VictoriaMetrics [Enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/) components support automatic issuing of TLS certificates for public HTTPS server running at `-httpListenAddr`
via [Let's Encrypt service](https://letsencrypt.org/). The following command-line flags must be set in order to enable automatic issuing of TLS certificates:

* `-httpListenAddr` must be set for listening TCP port `443`. For example, `-httpListenAddr=:443`. This port must be accessible by the [Let's Encrypt service](https://letsencrypt.org/).
* `-tls` must be set in order to accept HTTPS requests at `-httpListenAddr`. Note that `-tlcCertFile` and `-tlsKeyFile` aren't needed when automatic TLS certificate issuing is enabled.
* `-tlsAutocertHosts` must be set to comma-separated list of hosts, which can be reached via `-httpListenAddr`. TLS certificates are automatically issued for these hosts.
* `-tlsAutocertEmail` must be set to contact email for the issued TLS certificates.
* `-tlsAutocertCacheDir` may be set to the directory path for persisting the issued TLS certificates between VictoriaMetrics restarts. If this flag isn't set,
  then TLS certificates are re-issued on every restart.

This functionality can be evaluated for free according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/).

See also [security recommendations](#security).

## Tuning

* No need in tuning for VictoriaMetrics - it uses reasonable defaults for command-line flags,
  which are automatically adjusted for the available CPU and RAM resources.
* No need in tuning for Operating System - VictoriaMetrics is optimized for default OS settings.
  The only option is increasing the limit on [the number of open files in the OS](https://medium.com/@muhammadtriwibowo/set-permanently-ulimit-n-open-files-in-ubuntu-4d61064429a).
  The recommendation is not specific for VictoriaMetrics only but also for any service which handles many HTTP connections and stores data on disk.
* VictoriaMetrics is a write-heavy application and its performance depends on disk performance. So be careful with other
  applications or utilities (like [fstrim](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lunar/en/man8/fstrim.8.html))
  which could [exhaust disk resources](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1521).
* The recommended filesystem is `ext4`, the recommended persistent storage is [persistent HDD-based disk on GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/#pdspecs),
  since it is protected from hardware failures via internal replication and it can be [resized on the fly](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#resize_pd).
  If you plan to store more than 1TB of data on `ext4` partition or plan extending it to more than 16TB,
  then the following options are recommended to pass to `mkfs.ext4`:

```sh
mkfs.ext4 ... -O 64bit,huge_file,extent -T huge
```

## Monitoring

VictoriaMetrics exports internal metrics in Prometheus exposition format at `/metrics` page.
These metrics [can be scraped](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/deployment/docker/prometheus-vm-single.yml)
via [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/) or any other Prometheus-compatible scraper.

> Single-node VictoriaMetrics can self-scrape its metrics when `-selfScrapeInterval` command-line flag is
set to duration greater than 0. For example, `-selfScrapeInterval=10s` scrapes `/metrics` page every 10 seconds.

See the list of official [Grafana dashboards for VictoriaMetrics components](https://grafana.com/orgs/victoriametrics/dashboards).

Please follow the monitoring recommendations below:

* Prefer giving distinct scrape job names per each component type. I.e. `vmagent` and `vmalert` should have corresponding job names.
* Never use load balancer address for scraping metrics. All the monitored components should be scraped directly by their address.
* Set up [recommended alerts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker#alerts)
via [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/) or via Prometheus.
* See currently running queries and their execution times at [`active queries` page](#active-queries).
* See queries that take the most time to execute at [`top queries` page](#top-queries).

See also [VictoriaMetrics Monitoring](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/victoriametrics-monitoring/)
and [troubleshooting docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/troubleshooting/).

> VictoriaMetrics components do not expose metadata `TYPE` and `HELP` fields on `/metrics` page.
> Services like Google Cloud Managed Prometheus could require metadata to be present for scraping. In this case, pass `-metrics.exposeMetadata`
command-line to them. See [these docs](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/troubleshooting#missing-metric-type) for details.

## TSDB stats

VictoriaMetrics returns TSDB stats at `/api/v1/status/tsdb` page in the way similar to Prometheus - see [these Prometheus docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#tsdb-stats). VictoriaMetrics accepts the following optional query args at `/api/v1/status/tsdb` page:

* `topN=N` where `N` is the number of top entries to return in the response. By default, top 10 entries are returned.
* `date=YYYY-MM-DD` where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date for collecting the stats. By default, the stats is collected for the current day. Pass `date=1970-01-01` in order to collect global stats across all the days.
* `focusLabel=LABEL_NAME` returns label values with the highest number of time series for the given `LABEL_NAME` in the `seriesCountByFocusLabelValue` list.
* `match[]=SELECTOR` where `SELECTOR` is an arbitrary [time series selector](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-series-selectors) for series to take into account during stats calculation. By default all the series are taken into account.
* `extra_label=LABEL=VALUE`. See [these docs](#prometheus-querying-api-enhancements) for more details.

In [cluster version of VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/) each vmstorage tracks the stored time series individually.
vmselect requests stats via [/api/v1/status/tsdb](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#apiv1statustsdb) API from each vmstorage node and merges the results by summing per-series stats.
This may lead to inflated values when samples for the same time series are spread across multiple vmstorage nodes
due to [replication](#replication) or [rerouting](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#cluster-availability).

VictoriaMetrics provides UI on top of `/api/v1/status/tsdb` - see [cardinality explorer docs](#cardinality-explorer).

VictoriaMetrics enhances Prometheus stats with `requestsCount` and `lastRequestTimestamp` for `seriesCountByMetricName`. This stats added if [tracking metric names stats](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#track-ingested-metrics-usage) is configured.

## Track ingested metrics usage

VictoriaMetrics can track statistics of fetched [metric names](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#structure-of-a-metric)
during [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#query-data) {{% available_from "v1.113.0" %}}. It tracks
only metric names, as the number of names is usually limited (thousands) compared to time series (millions or billions).
This feature can be disabled via the flag `--storage.trackMetricNamesStats=false` (**enabled by default**) on a single-node
VictoriaMetrics or [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#architecture-overview).

During querying, VictoriaMetrics tracks how many times the requested metric name was fetched from the database and
when was the last time it happened. In this way, it is possible to identify metric names that were never queried.
Or if metric was queried occasionally - when the last time it happened.

The usage stats for a metric won't update in these two cases:

* Querying a metric with non-matching filters. For example, querying for `vm_log_messages_total{level!="info"}` won't update usage stats
  for `vm_log_messages_total` if there is no `{level!="info"}` series yet.
* The query response is fully cached in the [rollup result cache](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#rollup-result-cache).

To get metric names usage statistics, use the `/prometheus/api/v1/status/metric_names_stats` API endpoint for
a single-node VictoriaMetrics (or at `http://<vmselect>:8481/select/<accountID>/prometheus/api/v1/status/metric_names_stats` in [cluster version of VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/)).
It accepts the following query parameters:

* `limit` - integer value to limit the number of metric names in response. By default, API returns 1000 records.
* `le` - `less than or equal`, is an integer threshold for filtering metric names by their usage count in queries.
  For example, with `?le=1` API returns metric names that were queried <=1 times.
* `match_pattern` - a regex pattern to match metric names. For example, `?match_pattern=vm_` will match any metric
  names with `vm_` pattern, like `vm_http_requests`, `max_vm_memory_available`.

The API endpoint returns the following `JSON` response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "statsCollectedSince": 1737534094,
  "statsCollectedRecordsTotal": 2,
  "records": [
    {
      "metricName": "node_disk_writes_completed_total",
      "queryRequestsCount": 50,
      "lastRequestTimestamp": 1737534262
    },
    {
      "metricName": "node_network_transmit_errs_total",
      "queryRequestsCount": 100,
      "lastRequestTimestamp": 1737534262
    }
  ]
}
```

* `statsCollectedSince` is a timestamp since tracker was enabled (or reset, see below);
* `statsCollectedRecordsTotal` total number of metric names it contains;
* `records`:
  * `metricName` a metric name;
  * `queryRequestsCount` a cumulative counter of times the metric was fetched. If metric name `foo` has 10 time series,
    then one read query `foo` will increment counter by 10.
  * `lastRequestTimestamp` a timestamp when last time this statistic was updated.

**VictoriaMetrics tracks metric names query statistics for `/api/v1/query`, `/api/v1/query_range`, `/render`, `/federate` and `/api/v1/export` API calls.**

VictoriaMetrics stores tracked metric names in memory and saves the state to disk in the `<-storageDataPath>/cache` folder during restarts.
The size of the in-memory state is limited to **1%** of the available memory by default.
This limit can be adjusted using the `-storage.cacheSizeMetricNamesStats` flag.

When the maximum state capacity is reached, VictoriaMetrics will stop tracking stats for newly registered time series.
However, read request statistics for already tracked time series will continue to work as expected.

VictoriaMetrics exposes the following metrics for the metric name tracker:

* `vm_cache_size_bytes{type="storage/metricNamesStatsTracker"}`
* `vm_cache_size{type="storage/metricNamesStatsTracker"}`
* `vm_cache_size_max_bytes{type="storage/metricNamesStatsTracker"}`

An alerting rule with query `vm_cache_size_bytes{type="storage/metricNamesStatsTracker"} \ vm_cache_size_max_bytes{type="storage/metricNamesStatsTracker"} > 0.9`
can be used to notify the user of cache utilization exceeding 90%.

The metric name tracker state can be **reset** via the API endpoint `/api/v1/admin/status/metric_names_stats/reset`
for a single-node VictoriaMetrics (or at `http://<vmselect>:8481/admin/api/v1/admin/status/metric_names_stats/reset`
in [cluster version of VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/)) or
via [cache removal](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#cache-removal) procedure. This reset state endpoint can be protected via `-metricNamesStatsResetAuthKey`
cmd-line flag. See [Security](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#security) for details.

## Query tracing

VictoriaMetrics supports query tracing, which can be used for determining bottlenecks during query processing.
This is like `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` from Postgresql.

Query tracing can be enabled for a specific query by passing `trace=1` query arg.
In this case VictoriaMetrics puts query trace into `trace` field in the output JSON.

For example, the following command:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8428/api/v1/query_range -d 'query=2*rand()' -d 'start=-1h' -d 'step=1m' -d 'trace=1' | jq '.trace'
```

would return the following trace:

```json
{
  "duration_msec": 0.099,
  "message": "/api/v1/query_range: start=1654034340000, end=1654037880000, step=60000, query=\"2*rand()\": series=1",
  "children": [
    {
      "duration_msec": 0.034,
      "message": "eval: query=2 * rand(), timeRange=[1654034340000..1654037880000], step=60000, mayCache=true: series=1, points=60, pointsPerSeries=60",
      "children": [
        {
          "duration_msec": 0.032,
          "message": "binary op \"*\": series=1",
          "children": [
            {
              "duration_msec": 0.009,
              "message": "eval: query=2, timeRange=[1654034340000..1654037880000], step=60000, mayCache=true: series=1, points=60, pointsPerSeries=60"
            },
            {
              "duration_msec": 0.017,
              "message": "eval: query=rand(), timeRange=[1654034340000..1654037880000], step=60000, mayCache=true: series=1, points=60, pointsPerSeries=60",
              "children": [
                {
                  "duration_msec": 0.015,
                  "message": "transform rand(): series=1"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "duration_msec": 0.004,
      "message": "sort series by metric name and labels"
    },
    {
      "duration_msec": 0.044,
      "message": "generate /api/v1/query_range response for series=1, points=60"
    }
  ]
}
```

All the durations and timestamps in traces are in milliseconds.

Query tracing is allowed by default. It can be denied by passing `-denyQueryTracing` command-line flag to VictoriaMetrics.

[VMUI](#vmui) provides an UI:

* for query tracing - just click `Trace query` checkbox and re-run the query in order to investigate its' trace.
* for exploring custom trace - go to the tab `Trace analyzer` and upload or paste JSON with trace information.

## Cardinality limiter

By default, VictoriaMetrics doesn't limit the number of stored time series. The limit can be enforced by setting the following command-line flags:

* `-storage.maxHourlySeries` - limits the number of time series that can be added during the last hour. Useful for limiting the number of [active time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-an-active-time-series).
* `-storage.maxDailySeries` - limits the number of time series that can be added during the last day. Useful for limiting daily [churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-high-churn-rate).

Both limits can be set simultaneously. If any of these limits is reached, then incoming samples for new time series are dropped. A sample of dropped series is put in the log with `WARNING` level.

The exceeded limits can be [monitored](#monitoring) with the following metrics:

* `vm_hourly_series_limit_rows_dropped_total` - the number of metrics dropped due to exceeded hourly limit on the number of unique time series.

* `vm_hourly_series_limit_max_series` - the hourly series limit set via `-storage.maxHourlySeries` command-line flag.

* `vm_hourly_series_limit_current_series` - the current number of unique series during the last hour.
  The following query can be useful for alerting when the number of unique series during the last hour exceeds 90% of the `-storage.maxHourlySeries`:

  ```metricsql
  vm_hourly_series_limit_current_series / vm_hourly_series_limit_max_series > 0.9
  ```

* `vm_daily_series_limit_rows_dropped_total` - the number of metrics dropped due to exceeded daily limit on the number of unique time series.

* `vm_daily_series_limit_max_series` - the daily series limit set via `-storage.maxDailySeries` command-line flag.

* `vm_daily_series_limit_current_series` - the current number of unique series during the last day.
  The following query can be useful for alerting when the number of unique series during the last day exceeds 90% of the `-storage.maxDailySeries`:

  ```metricsql
  vm_daily_series_limit_current_series / vm_daily_series_limit_max_series > 0.9
  ```

These limits are approximate, so VictoriaMetrics can underflow/overflow the limit by a small percentage (usually less than 1%).

See also more advanced [cardinality limiter in vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/#cardinality-limiter)
and [cardinality explorer docs](#cardinality-explorer).

## Troubleshooting

* It is recommended to use default command-line flag values (i.e. don't set them explicitly) until the need
  of tweaking these flag values arises.

* It is recommended inspecting logs during troubleshooting, since they may contain useful information.

* It is recommended upgrading to the latest available release from [this page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest),
  since the encountered issue could be already fixed there.

* It is recommended to have at least 50% of spare resources for CPU, disk IO and RAM, so VictoriaMetrics could handle short spikes in the workload without performance issues.

* VictoriaMetrics requires free disk space for [merging data files to bigger ones](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282).
  It may slow down when there is no enough free space left. So make sure `-storageDataPath` directory
  has at least 20% of free space. The remaining amount of free space
  can be [monitored](#monitoring) via `vm_free_disk_space_bytes` metric. The total size of data
  stored on the disk can be monitored via sum of `vm_data_size_bytes` metrics.

* If you run VictoriaMetrics on a host with 16 or more CPU cores, then it may be needed to tune the `-search.maxWorkersPerQuery` command-line flag
  in order to improve query performance. If VictoriaMetrics serves big number of concurrent `select` queries, then try reducing the value for this flag.
  If VictoriaMetrics serves heavy queries, which select `>10K` of [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#time-series) and/or process `>100M`
  of [raw samples](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#raw-samples) per query, then try setting the value for this flag to the number of available CPU cores.

* VictoriaMetrics buffers incoming data in memory for up to a few seconds before flushing it to persistent storage.
  This may lead to the following "issues":
  * Data becomes available for querying in a few seconds after inserting. It is possible to flush in-memory buffers to searchable parts
    by requesting `/internal/force_flush` http handler. This handler is mostly needed for testing and debugging purposes.
  * The last few seconds of inserted data may be lost on unclean shutdown (i.e. OOM, `kill -9` or hardware reset).
    The `-inmemoryDataFlushInterval` command-line flag allows controlling the frequency of in-memory data flush to persistent storage.
    See [storage docs](#storage) and [this article](https://valyala.medium.com/wal-usage-looks-broken-in-modern-time-series-databases-b62a627ab704) for more details.

* If VictoriaMetrics works slowly and eats more than a CPU core per 100K ingested data points per second,
  then it is likely you have too many [active time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-an-active-time-series) for the current amount of RAM.
  VictoriaMetrics [exposes](#monitoring) `vm_slow_*` metrics such as `vm_slow_row_inserts_total` and `vm_slow_metric_name_loads_total`, which could be used
  as an indicator of low amounts of RAM. It is recommended increasing the amount of RAM on the node with VictoriaMetrics in order to improve
  ingestion and query performance in this case.

* If the order of labels for the same metrics can change over time (e.g. if `metric{k1="v1",k2="v2"}` may become `metric{k2="v2",k1="v1"}`),
  then it is recommended running VictoriaMetrics with `-sortLabels` command-line flag in order to reduce memory usage and CPU usage.

* VictoriaMetrics prioritizes data ingestion over data querying. So if it has no enough resources for data ingestion,
  then data querying may slow down significantly.

* If VictoriaMetrics doesn't work because of certain parts are corrupted due to disk errors,
  then just remove directories with broken parts. It is safe removing subdirectories under `<-storageDataPath>/data/{big,small}/YYYY_MM` directories
  when VictoriaMetrics isn't running. This recovers VictoriaMetrics at the cost of data loss stored in the deleted broken parts.
  The names of broken parts should be present in the error message. If you see that error message is truncated and doesn't contain all the information
  try increasing `-loggerMaxArgLen` cmd-line flag to higher values to avoid error messages truncation.

* If you see gaps on the graphs, try resetting the cache by sending request to `/internal/resetRollupResultCache`.
  If this removes gaps on the graphs, then it is likely data with timestamps older than `-search.cacheTimestampOffset`
  is ingested into VictoriaMetrics. Make sure that data sources have synchronized time with VictoriaMetrics.

  If the gaps are related to irregular intervals between samples, then try adjusting `-search.minStalenessInterval` command-line flag
  to value close to the maximum interval between samples.

* If you are switching from InfluxDB or TimescaleDB, then it may be needed to set `-search.setLookbackToStep` command-line flag.
  This suppresses default gap filling algorithm used by VictoriaMetrics - by default it assumes
  each time series is continuous instead of discrete, so it fills gaps between real samples with regular intervals.

* Metrics and labels leading to [high cardinality](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-high-cardinality)
  or [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/faq/#what-is-high-churn-rate) can be determined
  via [cardinality explorer](#cardinality-explorer) and via [/api/v1/status/tsdb](#tsdb-stats) endpoint.

* New time series can be logged if `-logNewSeries` command-line flag is passed to VictoriaMetrics or temporary enabled via `/internal/log_new_series` API call.
  `/internal/log_new_series` API accepts query parameter `seconds`, with default value of `60`, which defines a duration for logging newly created series.

* VictoriaMetrics limits the number of labels per each series, label name length and label value length
  via `-maxLabelsPerTimeseries`, `-maxLabelNameLen` and `-maxLabelValueLen` command-line flags respectively.
  Series that exceed the limits are ignored on ingestion. This prevents from ingesting malformed series.
  It is recommended [monitoring](#monitoring) `vm_rows_ignored_total` metric and VictoriaMetrics logs in order
  to determine whether limits must be adjusted for your workload.
  Alternatively, you can use [relabeling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#relabeling) to change metric target labels.

* If you store Graphite metrics like `foo.bar.baz` in VictoriaMetrics, then `{__graphite__="foo.*.baz"}` filter can be used for selecting such metrics.
  See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/graphite/#selecting-graphite-metrics) for details. You can also query Graphite metrics with [Graphite querying API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/graphite/#render-api).

* VictoriaMetrics ignores `NaN` values during data ingestion.

* [General troubleshooting docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/troubleshooting/).

## Push metrics

All the VictoriaMetrics components support pushing their metrics exposed at `/metrics` page to remote storage in Prometheus text exposition format.
This functionality may be used instead of [classic Prometheus-like metrics scraping](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#how-to-scrape-prometheus-exporters-such-as-node-exporter)
if VictoriaMetrics components are located in isolated networks, so they cannot be scraped by local [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/).

The following command-line flags are related to pushing metrics from VictoriaMetrics components:

* `-pushmetrics.url` - the url to push metrics to. For example, `-pushmetrics.url=http://victoria-metrics:8428/api/v1/import/prometheus` instructs
  to push internal metrics to `/api/v1/import/prometheus` endpoint according to [these docs](#how-to-import-data-in-prometheus-exposition-format).
  The `-pushmetrics.url` can be specified multiple times. In this case metrics are pushed to all the specified urls.
  The url can contain basic auth params in the form `http://user:pass@hostname/api/v1/import/prometheus`.
  Metrics are pushed to the provided `-pushmetrics.url` in a compressed form with `Content-Encoding: gzip` request header.
  This allows reducing the required network bandwidth for metrics push. The compression can be disabled by passing `-pushmetrics.disableCompression` command-line flag.
* `-pushmetrics.extraLabel` - labels to add to all the metrics before sending them to every `-pushmetrics.url`. Each label must be specified in the format `label="value"`.
  It is OK to specify multiple `-pushmetrics.extraLabel` command-line flags. In this case all the specified labels
  are added to all the metrics before sending them to all the configured `-pushmetrics.url` addresses.
* `-pushmetrics.interval` - the interval between pushes. By default it is set to 10 seconds.
* `-pushmetrics.header` - an optional HTTP header to send to every `-pushmetrics.url`. For example, `-pushmetrics.header='Authorization: Basic foo'` instructs to send
  `Authorization: Basic foo` HTTP header with every request to every `-pushmetrics.url`. It is possible to set multiple `-pushmetrics.header` command-line flags
  for sending multiple different HTTP headers to `-pushmetrics.url`.

For example, the following command instructs VictoriaMetrics to push metrics from `/metrics` page to `https://maas.victoriametrics.com/api/v1/import/prometheus`
with `user:pass` [Basic auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). The `instance="foobar"` and `job="vm"` labels
are added to all the metrics before sending them to the remote storage:

```sh
/path/to/victoria-metrics \
  -pushmetrics.url=https://user:pass@maas.victoriametrics.com/api/v1/import/prometheus \
  -pushmetrics.extraLabel='instance="foobar"' \
  -pushmetrics.extraLabel='job="vm"'
```

## Caches

### Cache removal

VictoriaMetrics uses various internal caches. These caches are stored to `<-storageDataPath>/cache` directory during graceful shutdown
(e.g. when VictoriaMetrics is stopped by sending `SIGINT` signal). The caches are read on the next VictoriaMetrics startup.
Sometimes it is needed to remove such caches on the next startup. This can be done in the following ways:

* By manually removing the `<-storageDataPath>/cache` directory when VictoriaMetrics is stopped.
* By placing `reset_cache_on_startup` file inside the `<-storageDataPath>/cache` directory before the restart of VictoriaMetrics.
  In this case VictoriaMetrics will automatically remove all the caches on the next start.
  See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1447) for details.

It is also possible removing [rollup result cache](#rollup-result-cache) on startup by passing `-search.resetRollupResultCacheOnStartup` command-line flag to VictoriaMetrics.

### Rollup result cache

VictoriaMetrics caches query responses by default. This allows increasing performance for repeated queries
to [`/api/v1/query`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#instant-query) and [`/api/v1/query_range`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/keyconcepts/#range-query)
with the increasing `time`, `start` and `end` query args.

This cache may work incorrectly when ingesting historical data into VictoriaMetrics. See [these docs](#backfilling) for details.

The rollup cache can be disabled either globally by running VictoriaMetrics with `-search.disableCache` command-line flag
or on a per-query basis by passing `nocache=1` query arg to `/api/v1/query` and `/api/v1/query_range`.

See also [cache removal docs](#cache-removal).

### Cache tuning

VictoriaMetrics uses various in-memory caches for faster data ingestion and query performance.
The following metrics for each type of cache are exported at [`/metrics` page](#monitoring):

* `vm_cache_size_bytes` - the actual cache size
* `vm_cache_size_max_bytes` - cache size limit
* `vm_cache_requests_total` - the number of requests to the cache
* `vm_cache_misses_total` - the number of cache misses
* `vm_cache_entries` - the number of entries in the cache

Both Grafana dashboards for [single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10229)
and [clustered VictoriaMetrics](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176)
contain `Caches` section with cache metrics visualized. The panels show the current
memory usage by each type of cache, and also a cache hit rate. If hit rate is close to 100%
then cache efficiency is already very high and does not need any tuning.
The panel `Cache usage %` in `Troubleshooting` section shows the percentage of used cache size
from the allowed size by type. If the percentage is below 100%, then no further tuning needed.

Please note, default cache sizes were carefully adjusted accordingly to the most
practical scenarios and workloads. Change the defaults only if you understand the implications
and vmstorage has enough free memory to accommodate new cache sizes.

To override the default values see command-line flags with `-storage.cacheSize` prefix.
See the full description of [command-line flags](#list-of-command-line-flags).

## Data migration

### From VictoriaMetrics

The simplest way to migrate data from one single-node (source) to another (destination), or from one vmstorage node
to another is to do the following:

1. Stop the VictoriaMetrics (source) with `kill -INT`;
1. Copy (via [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) or any other tool) the entire folder specified
via `-storageDataPath` from the source node to **an empty folder** at the destination node.
1. Once copy is done, stop the VictoriaMetrics (destination) with `kill -INT` and verify that
its `-storageDataPath` points to the copied folder from p.2;
1. Start the VictoriaMetrics (destination). The copied data should be now available.

Things to consider when copying data:

* Data formats between single-node and vmstorage node aren't compatible and can't be copied.
* Copying a data folder means complete replacement of the previous data on destination VictoriaMetrics.
* Data can't be mixed: make sure that the destination folder **is empty** before copying.

For scenarios like single-to-cluster, cluster-to-single, re-sharding or migrating only a fraction of data: 
[see how to migrate data from VictoriaMetrics via vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmctl/victoriametrics/).

### From other systems

Use [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmctl/) to migrate data from other systems to VictoriaMetrics.

## Backfilling

VictoriaMetrics accepts out-of-order historical data via [any supported ingestion method](#how-to-import-time-series-data)
without limitations. Only make sure that backfilled data is within of the configured [retention period](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#retention).

> See [how to backfill recording rules via vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/#rules-backfilling).

It is recommended disabling [query cache](#rollup-result-cache) with `-search.disableCache` command-line flag when writing
historical data with timestamps from the past, since the cache assumes that the data is written with
the current timestamps. Query cache can be enabled after the backfilling is complete.

An alternative solution is to query [/internal/resetRollupResultCache](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/url-examples/#internalresetrollupresultcache)
after the backfilling is complete. This will reset the [query cache](#rollup-result-cache), which could contain incomplete data cached during the backfilling.

Yet another solution is to increase `-search.cacheTimestampOffset` flag value to disable caching
for data with timestamps close to the current time. Single-node VictoriaMetrics automatically resets response
cache when samples with timestamps older than `now - search.cacheTimestampOffset` are ingested to it.

## Data updates

VictoriaMetrics doesn't support updating already existing sample values to new ones. It stores all the ingested data points
for the same time series with identical timestamps. While it is possible substituting old time series with new time series via
[removal of old time series](#how-to-delete-time-series) and then [writing new time series](#backfilling), this approach
should be used only for one-off updates. It shouldn't be used for frequent updates because of non-zero overhead related to data removal.

## Replication

Single-node VictoriaMetrics doesn't support application-level replication. Use cluster version instead.
See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/#replication-and-data-safety) for details.

Storage-level replication may be offloaded to durable persistent storage such as [Google Cloud disks](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#pdspecs).

See also [high availability docs](#high-availability) and [backup docs](#backups).

## Backups

For backup configuration and setup, please refer to [vmbackup documentation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackup/).


## vmalert

A single-node VictoriaMetrics is capable of proxying requests to [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/)
when `-vmalert.proxyURL` flag is set. Use this feature for the following cases:

* for proxying requests from [Grafana Alerting UI](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/);
* for accessing vmalerts UI through single-node VictoriaMetrics Web interface.

For accessing vmalerts UI through single-node VictoriaMetrics configure `-vmalert.proxyURL` flag and visit
`http://<victoriametrics-addr>:8428/vmalert/` link.

## Benchmarks

Note, that vendors (including VictoriaMetrics) are often biased when doing such tests. E.g. they try highlighting
the best parts of their product, while highlighting the worst parts of competing products.
So we encourage users and all independent third parties to conduct their benchmarks for various products
they are evaluating in production and publish the results.

As a reference, please see [benchmarks](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/articles/#benchmarks) conducted by
VictoriaMetrics team. Please also see the [helm chart](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/benchmark)
for running ingestion benchmarks based on node_exporter metrics.

## Profiling

VictoriaMetrics provides handlers for collecting the following [Go profiles](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs):

* Memory profile. It can be collected with the following command (replace `0.0.0.0` with hostname if needed):

```sh
curl http://0.0.0.0:8428/debug/pprof/heap > mem.pprof
```

* CPU profile. It can be collected with the following command (replace `0.0.0.0` with hostname if needed):

```sh
curl http://0.0.0.0:8428/debug/pprof/profile > cpu.pprof
```

The command for collecting CPU profile waits for 30 seconds before returning.

The collected profiles may be analyzed with [go tool pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof).
It is safe sharing the collected profiles from security point of view, since they do not contain sensitive information.

### Images in documentation

Please, keep image size and number of images per single page low. Keep the docs page as lightweight as possible.

Image files must be placed in the same folder as the doc itself and they must have the same prefix as the doc filename.
For example, all the images for `docs/foo/bar.md` should have filenames starting from `docs/foo/bar`.
This simplifies lifetime management of the images:

* when the corresponding doc is removed, then it is clear how to remove the associated images
* when the corresponding doc is renamed, then it is clear how to rename the associated images.

If the page needs to have many images, consider using WEB-optimized image format [webp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp).
When adding a new doc with many images use `webp` format right away. Or use a Makefile command below to
convert already existing images at `docs` folder automatically to `web` format:

```sh
make docs-images-to-webp
```

Once conversion is done, update the path to images in your docs and verify everything is correct.

## VictoriaMetrics Logo

[Zip](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/VM_logo.zip) contains three folders with different image orientations (main color and inverted version).

Files included in each folder:

* 2 JPEG Preview files
* 2 PNG Preview files with transparent background
* 2 EPS Adobe Illustrator EPS10 files

### Logo Usage Guidelines

#### Font used

* Lato Black
* Lato Regular

#### Color Palette

* HEX [#110f0f](https://www.color-hex.com/color/110f0f)
* HEX [#ffffff](https://www.color-hex.com/color/ffffff)

### We kindly ask

* Please don't use any other font instead of suggested.
* To keep enough clear space around the logo.
* Do not change spacing, alignment, or relative locations of the design elements.
* Do not change the proportions for any of the design elements or the design itself.
  You may resize as needed but must retain all proportions.
