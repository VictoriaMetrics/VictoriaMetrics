vmagent collects metrics data via popular data ingestion protocols and routes it to VictoriaMetrics.

See the docs at https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/ .

     The number of cache misses before putting the block into cache. Higher values may reduce indexdb/dataBlocks cache size at the cost of higher CPU and disk read usage (default 2)
  -cacheExpireDuration duration
     Items are removed from in-memory caches after they aren't accessed for this duration. Lower values may reduce memory usage at the cost of higher CPU usage. See also -prevCacheRemovalPercent (default 30m0s)
