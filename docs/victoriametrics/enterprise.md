## Running VictoriaMetrics Enterprise

Enterprise components of VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs are available in the following forms:

- [Binary releases](#binary-releases)
- [Docker images](#docker-images)
- [Helm charts](#helm-charts)
- [Kubernetes operator](#kubernetes-operator)

### Binary releases

It is allowed to run VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs Enterprise components in [cases listed here](#valid-cases-for-victoriametrics-enterprise).

Binary releases of Enterprise components are available at [the releases page for VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest)
and [the releases page for VictoriaLogs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/latest).
Enterprise binaries and packages have `enterprise` suffix in their names. For example, `victoria-metrics-linux-amd64-v1.126.0-enterprise.tar.gz`.

In order to run binary release of Enterprise component, please download the `*-enterprise.tar.gz` archive for your OS and architecture
from the corresponding releases page and unpack it. Then run the unpacked binary.

All the Enterprise components of VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs require specifying the following command-line flags:

- `-license` - this flag accepts VictoriaMetrics Enterprise license key, which can be obtained at [this page](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/trial/)
- `-licenseFile` - this flag accepts a path to file with VictoriaMetrics Enterprise license key,
  which can be obtained at [this page](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/trial/) . Use either `-license` or `-licenseFile`, but not both.
- `-licenseFile.reloadInterval` - specifies the interval for checking the license file for updates. The default value is 1 hour. If the license file is updated, the new license key is read from the file.
- `-license.forceOffline` - enables offline verification of VictoriaMetrics Enterprise license key. Contact us via [this page](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/)
  if you need license key, which can be verified offline without the need to connect to VictoriaMetrics license server.

For example, the following command runs VictoriaMetrics Enterprise binary with the Enterprise license
obtained at [this page](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/trial/):

```sh
wget https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/download/v1.126.0/victoria-metrics-linux-amd64-v1.126.0-enterprise.tar.gz
tar -xzf victoria-metrics-linux-amd64-v1.126.0-enterprise.tar.gz
./victoria-metrics-prod -license=BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE_KEY
```

Alternatively, VictoriaMetrics Enterprise license can be stored in the file and then referred via `-licenseFile` command-line flag:

```sh
./victoria-metrics-prod -licenseFile=/path/to/vm-license
```

### Docker images

It is allowed to run VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs Enterprise components in [cases listed here](#valid-cases-for-victoriametrics-enterprise).

Docker images for Enterprise components are available at [VictoriaMetrics Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/victoriametrics) and [VictoriaMetrics Quay](https://quay.io/organization/victoriametrics).
Enterprise docker images have `enterprise` suffix in their names. For example, `victoriametrics/victoria-metrics:v1.126.0-enterprise`.

In order to run Docker image of VictoriaMetrics Enterprise component, it is required to provide the license key via the command-line
flag as described in the [binary-releases](#binary-releases) section.

Enterprise license key can be obtained at [this page](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/trial/).

For example, the following command runs VictoriaMetrics Enterprise Docker image with the specified license key:

```sh
docker run --name=victoria-metrics victoriametrics/victoria-metrics:v1.126.0-enterprise -license=BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE_KEY
```

Alternatively, the license code can be stored in the file and then referred via `-licenseFile` command-line flag:

```sh
docker run --name=victoria-metrics -v /vm-license:/vm-license  victoriametrics/victoria-metrics:v1.126.0-enterprise -licenseFile=/path/to/vm-license
```

Example docker-compose configuration:

```yaml
version: "3.5"
services:
  victoriametrics:
    container_name: victoriametrics
    image: victoriametrics/victoria-metrics:v1.126.0
    ports:
      - 8428:8428
    volumes:
      - vmdata:/storage
      - /vm-license:/vm-license
    command:
      - "-storageDataPath=/storage"
      - "-licenseFile=/vm-license"
volumes:
  vmdata: {}
```

The example assumes that the license file is stored at `/vm-license` on the host.

### Helm charts

It is allowed to run VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs Enterprise components in [cases listed here](#valid-cases-for-victoriametrics-enterprise).

Helm charts for Enterprise components are available in our VictoriaMetrics [Helm repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts).

In order to run Enterprise helm chart it is required to provide the license key via `license` value in `values.yaml` file
and adjust the image tag to the Enterprise one as described in the [docker-images](#docker-images) section.

Enterprise license key can be obtained at [this page](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/trial/).

For example, the following `values` file for [VictoriaMetrics single-node chart](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/victoria-metrics-single)
is used to provide the license key in plain-text:

```yaml
server:
  image:
    tag: v1.126.0-enterprise

license:
  key: {BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE_KEY}
```

In order to provide the license key via existing secret, the following values file is used:

```yaml
server:
  image:
    tag: v1.126.0-enterprise

license:
  secret:
    name: vm-license
    key: license
```

Example secret with license key:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vm-license
type: Opaque
data:
  license: {BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE_KEY}
```

Or create secret via `kubectl`:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic vm-license --from-literal=license={BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE_KEY}
```

Note that license key provided by using secret is mounted in a file. This allows to perform updates of the license without the need to restart the pod.

### Kubernetes operator

It is allowed to run VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs Enterprise components in [cases listed here](#valid-cases-for-victoriametrics-enterprise).

Enterprise components can be deployed via [VictoriaMetrics operator](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/operator/).
In order to use Enterprise components it is required to provide the license key via `license` field and adjust the image tag to the enterprise one.

Enterprise license key can be obtained at [this page](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/trial/).

For example, the following custom resource for [VictoriaMetrics single-node](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/)
is used to provide the license key in plain-text:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1
kind: VMSingle
metadata:
  name: example-vmsingle
spec:
  retentionPeriod: "1"
  license:
    key: {BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE_KEY}
  image:
    tag: v1.126.0-enterprise
```

In order to provide the license key via existing secret, the following custom resource is used:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1
kind: VMSingle
metadata:
  name: example-vmsingle
spec:
  retentionPeriod: "1"
  license:
    keyRef:
      name: vm-license
      key: license
  image:
    tag: v1.126.0-enterprise
```

Example secret with license key:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vm-license
type: Opaque
data:
  license: {BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE_KEY}
```

Or create secret via `kubectl`:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic vm-license --from-literal=license={BASE64_ENCODED_LICENSE_KEY}
```

Note that license key provided by using secret is mounted in a file. This allows to perform updates of the license without the need to restart the pod.
See full list of the CRD specifications in the [Operator API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/operator/api/).

### FIPS Compatibility

VictoriaMetrics Enterprise supports [FIPS 140-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-3) compliant mode starting with version {{% available_from "v1.118.0" %}},
using the [Go FIPS 140-3 Cryptographic Module](https://go.dev/blog/fips140). This ensures all cryptographic operations use a validated FIPS module.

Builds are available for amd64 and arm64 architectures.

Example archive:

`victoria-metrics-linux-amd64-v1.126.0-enterprise.tar.gz`

Includes:

- `victoria-metrics-prod` (standard)
- `victoria-metrics-fips` (FIPS-compatible)

Example Docker image:

`victoriametrics/victoria-metrics:v1.126.0-enterprise-fips` – uses the FIPS-compatible binary and based on `scratch` image.

## Monitoring license expiration

All the VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs Enterprise components expose the following metrics at the `/metrics` page:

- `vm_license_expires_at` - license expiration date in unix timestamp format
- `vm_license_expires_in_seconds` - the number of seconds left until the license expires

Example alerts for [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/) based on these metrics:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: vm-license
    # note the `job` label and update accordingly to your setup
    rules:
      - alert: LicenseExpiresInLessThan30Days
        expr: vm_license_expires_in_seconds < 30 * 24 * 3600
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "{{ $labels.job }} instance {{ $labels.instance }} license expires in less than 30 days"
          description: "{{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }} license expires in {{ $value | humanizeDuration }}.
            Please make sure to update the license before it expires."

      - alert: LicenseExpiresInLessThan7Days
        expr: vm_license_expires_in_seconds < 7 * 24 * 3600
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "{{ $labels.job }} instance {{ $labels.instance }} license expires in less than 7 days"
          description: "{{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }} license expires in {{ $value | humanizeDuration }}.
            Please make sure to update the license before it expires."
```
