The following `tip` changes can be tested by building VictoriaLogs from the latest commit of [VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/) repository
according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/quickstart/#building-from-source-code)

## tip

* FEATURE: add support for forced merge. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#forced-merge).
* FEATURE: skip empty log fields in query results, since they are treated as non-existing fields in [VictoriaLogs data model](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).

* BUGFIX: avoid possible panic when logs for a new day are ingested during execution of concurrent queries.
* BUGFIX: avoid panic at `lib/logstorage.(*blockResultColumn).forEachDictValue()` when [stats with additional filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-with-additional-filters). The panic has been introduced in [v0.33.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.33.0-victorialogs) in [this commit](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/commit/a350be48b68330ee1a487e1fb09b002d3be45163).


## [v0.35.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.35.0-victorialogs)

* FEATURE: [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/): add ability to live tail query results - see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/#live-tailing).
* FEATURE: [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/): add compact output mode for query results. It can be enabled by typing `\c` and then pressing `enter`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/#output-modes).
* FEATURE: [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/): add `-accountID` and `-projectID` command-line flags for setting `AccountID` and `ProjectID` values when querying the specific [tenants](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#multitenancy).

## [v0.34.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.34.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-10-08

* FEATURE: [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/): add ability to display results in `logfmt` mode, single-line and multi-line JSON modes according [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/#output-modes).
* FEATURE: [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/): preserve `less` output after the exit from scrolling mode. This should help re-using previous query results in subsequent queries.
* FEATURE: add [`len` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#len-pipe) for calculating the length for the given [log field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) value in bytes.

## [v0.33.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.33.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-10-01

* FEATURE: add interactive command-line tool for querying VictoriaLogs - [`vlogscli`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/).

* BUGFIX: [`count_uniq` stats function](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#count_uniq-stats): do not count field values, which aren't matched by the used filters. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7152).

## [v0.32.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.32.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-09-30

* BUGFIX: do not return field values with zero matching logs from [`field_values`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#field_values-pipe), [`top`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe) and [`uniq`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#uniq-pipe) pipes. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource/issues/72#issuecomment-2352078483).

## [v0.32.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.32.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-09-29

* FEATURE: [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/): accept Unix timestamps in seconds in the ingested logs. This simplifies integration with systems, which prefer Unix timestamps over text-based representation of time.
* FEATURE: [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe): allow using `order` alias instead of `sort`. For example, `_time:5s | order by (_time)` query works the same as `_time:5s | sort by (_time)`. This simplifies the to [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) transition from SQL-like query languages.
* FEATURE: [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe): allow using multiple identical [stats functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe-functions) with distinct [filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-with-additional-filters) and automatically generated result names. For example, `_time:5m | count(), count() if (error)` query works as expected now, e.g. it returns two results over the last 5 minutes: the total number of logs and the number of logs with `error` [word](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#word). Previously this query couldn't be executed because the `if (...)` condition wasn't included in the automatically generate result name, so both results had the same name - `count(*)`.

* BUGFIX: properly calculate [`uniq`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#uniq-pipe) and [`top`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe) pipes. Previously they could return invalid results in some cases.

## [v0.31.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.31.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-09-27

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): improved readability of staircase graphs and tooltip usability. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6545#issuecomment-2336805237).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): simplify query input by adding only the label name when `ctrl`+clicking the line legend. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6545#issuecomment-2336805237).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): keep selected columns in table view on page reloads. Before, selected columns were reset on each update. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7016).
* FEATURE: allow skipping `_stream:` prefix in [stream filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream-filter). This simplifies writing queries with stream filters. Now `{foo="bar"}` is the recommended format for stream filters over the `_stream:{foo="bar"}` format.
* FEATURE: allow using `-` instead of `!` as `NOT` operator shorthand in [logical filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#logical-filter). For example, `-info -warn` query is equivalent to `!info !warn`. This simplifies transition from other query languages with full-text search support, which usually use `-` as `NOT` operator.

## [v0.30.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.30.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-09-27

* BUGFIX: consistently return matching log streams sorted by time from [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe). Previously log streams could be returned in arbitrary order with every request. This could complicate using `stream_context` pipe.
* BUGFIX: [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe): add missing `_msg="---"` delimiter between stream contexts belonging to different [log streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields). This should simplify investigating `stream_context` output for multiple matching log streams.

## [v0.30.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.30.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-09-27

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add button for enabling auto refresh, similarly to VictoriaMetrics vmui. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7017).
* FEATURE: drop logs without [`_msg`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field) field or with empty `_msg` field, since this field is required to be non-empty in [VictoriaLogs data model](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6785).
* FEATURE: improve performance of analytical queries, which do not need reading the `_time` field. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7070).
* FEATURE: add [`blocks_count` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#blocks_count-pipe), which can be used for counting the number of matching blocks for the given query. For example, `_time:5m | blocks_count` returns the number of blocks with logs for the last 5 minutes. This pipe can be useful for debugging purposes.
* FEATURE: support [ingesting logs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/) with `_time` field, which doesn't contain timezone information. For example, `2024-09-20T10:20:30`. In this case the local timezone of the host where VictoriaLogs runs is used. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6721).
* FEATURE: reduce memory usage when [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe) is applied to [log streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) with big number of messages. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6730).

* BUGFIX: fix Windows build, which has been broken in [v0.29.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.29.0-victorialogs). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6973).
* BUGFIX: properly return logs from [`/select/logsql/tail` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#live-tailing) if the query contains [`_time:some_duration` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter) like `_time:5m`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7028). The bug has been introduced in [v0.29.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.29.0-victorialogs).
* BUGFIX: properly return logs without [`_msg`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field) field when `*` query is passed to [`/select/logsql/query` endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs) together with positive `limit` arg. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6785). Thanks to @jiekun for identifying the root cause of the issue.
* BUGFIX: support [ingesting logs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/) with `_time` field containing whitespace delimiter between the date and time instead of `T` delimiter. For example, `2024-09-20 10:20:30`. This is valid [ISO8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) aka `SQL datetime` format, which sometimes is used in production. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6721).
* BUGFIX: return all the requested surrounding logs for [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe). Previously only logs matching the [`_time` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter) were returned. This is needed for [this feature](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7063).

## [v0.29.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.29.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-09-08

* FEATURE: add [`/select/logsql/stats_query` HTTP API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-stats), which is going to be used by [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/) for executing alerting and recording rules against VictoriaLogs. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6942) for details.
* FEATURE: add [`/select/logsql/stats_query_range` HTTP API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-log-range-stats), which is going to be used by [VictoriaLogs plugin for Grafana](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/victorialogs-datasource/) for building time series panels. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6943) for details.
* FEATURE: optimize [multi-exact queries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#multi-exact-filter) with many phrases to search. For example, `ip:in(path:="/foo/bar" | keep ip)` when there are many unique values for `ip` field among log entries with `/foo/bar` path.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add support for displaying the top 5 log streams in the hits graph. The remaining log streams are grouped into an "other" label. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6545).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add the ability to customize the graph display with options for bar, line, stepped line, and points.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add fields for setting AccountID and ProjectID. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6631).

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add search functionality to the column display settings in the table. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6668).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add the ability to select all columns in the column display settings of the table. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6668). Thanks to @yincongcyincong for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6680).
* FEATURE: Allow to define ingestion parameters via headers. Supported headers - `VL-Msg-Field`,`VL-Stream-Fields`,`VL-Ignore-Fields`,`VL-Time-Field`, `VL-Debug`. See this [PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6443) for details.
* FEATURE: [vlinsert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/): added OpenTelemetry logs ingestion support. See this [PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6218) for details.

* BUGFIX: properly handle Logstash requests for Elasticsearch configuration when using `outputs.elasticsearch` in Logstash pipelines. Previously, the requests could be rejected with `400 Bad Request` response. Updates [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4750).
* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix `not found index.js` error when loading vmui in VictoriaLogs. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6764). Thanks to @yincongcyincong for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6770).
* BUGFIX: properly execute queries with `OR` [filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#logical-filter) for distinct [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). For example, `field1:foo OR field2:bar`. Previously logs matching these filters may be skipped during querying. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6554) for details. Thanks to @yincongcyincong for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6556).

## [v0.28.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.28.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-07-10

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): show a spinner on top of bar chart until user's request is finished. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6558).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): use compact representation of JSON lines at `JSON` tab if only a single [log field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) is queried. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6559).
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): properly show the number of matching logs on the selected time range at bar chart for queries with arbitrary [pipes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pipes), including [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) and [`top` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe).

## [v0.27.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.27.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-07-05

* BUGFIX: properly JSON-encode strings with special chars in [HTTP querying API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api) responses. This fixes the `error decode response: invalid character 'x' in string escape code` error in [VictoriaLogs datasource for Grafana](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource/). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource/issues/24). The issue has been introduced in the release [v0.9.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.9.0-victorialogs).

## [v0.27.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.27.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-07-02

* FEATURE: add `-syslog.useLocalTimestamp.tcp` and `-syslog.useLocalTimestamp.udp` command-line flags, which could be used for using the local timestamp as [`_time` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field) for the logs ingested via the corresponding `-syslog.listenAddr.tcp` / `-syslog.listenAddr.udp`. By default the timestap from the syslog message is used as [`_time` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/).

* BUGFIX: make slowly ingested logs visible for search as soon as they are ingested into VictoriaLogs. Previously slowly ingested logs could remain invisible for search for long time.

## [v0.26.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.26.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-07-01

* BUGFIX: return the proper surrounding logs for [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe) when additional [pipes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pipes) are put after the `stream_context` pipe. This has been broken in [v0.26.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.26.0-victorialogs).

## [v0.26.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.26.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-07-01

* FEATURE: add ability to return log position (aka rank) after sorting logs with [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe). This can be done by adding `rank as <fieldName>` to the end of `| sort ...` pipe. For example, `_time:5m | sort by (_time) rank as position` instructs storing position of every sorted log line into `position` [field name](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: add delimiter log with `---` message between log chunks returned by [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe). This should simplify investigation of the returned logs.
* FEATURE: reduce memory usage when big number of context logs are requested from [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe).

## [v0.25.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.25.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-28

* FEATURE: add ability to select surrounding logs in front and after the selected logs via [`stream_context` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe). This functionality may be useful for investigating stacktraces, panics or some correlated log messages. This functionality is similar to `grep -A` and `grep -B`.
* FEATURE: add ability to return top `N` `"fields"` groups from  [`/select/logsql/hits` HTTP endpoint](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-hits-stats), by specifying `fields_limit=N` query arg. This query arg is going to be used in [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6545).

* BUGFIX: fix `runtime error: index out of range [0] with length 0` panic when empty lines are ingested via [Syslog format](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/) by Cisco controllers. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6548).

## [v0.24.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.24.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-27

* FEATURE: add `/select/logsql/tail` HTTP endpoint, which can be used for live tailing of [LogsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) results. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#live-tailing) for details.
* FEATURE: add `/select/logsql/stream_ids` HTTP endpoint, which can be used for returning [`_stream_id` values](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) with the number of hits for the given [LogsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-stream_ids) for details.
* FEATURE: add `-retention.maxDiskSpaceUsageBytes` command-line flag, which allows limiting disk space usage for [VictoriaLogs data](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#storage) by automatic dropping the oldest per-day partitions if the storage disk space usage becomes bigger than the `-retention.maxDiskSpaceUsageBytes`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#retention-by-disk-space-usage).

* BUGFIX: properly take into account query timeout specified via `-search.maxQueryDuration` command-line flag and/or via `timeout` query arg. Previously these timeouts could be ignored during query execution.
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): fix the update of the relative time range when `Execute Query` is clicked. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6345).

## [v0.23.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.23.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-25

* FEATURE: [syslog data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/): parse [STRUCTURED-DATA](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5424#section-6.3) into `SD-ID.field1=value1`, `SD-ID.field2=value2`, ..., `SD-ID.fieldN=valueN` [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). Previously the `STRUCTURED-DATA` was parsed into a single log field with the `SD-ID` name and `field1=value1 field2=value2 ... fieldN=valueN` value. This could complicate querying of such data.

* BUGFIX: properly parse timestamps with timezones during [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/) and [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/). This has been broken in [v0.20.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.20.0-victorialogs). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6508).

## [v0.22.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.22.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-24

* FEATURE: allow specifying multiple `_stream_id` values in [`_stream_id` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#_stream_id-filter) via `_stream_id:in(id1, ..., idN)` syntax.
* FEATURE: allow specifying subquery for searching for `_stream_id` values inside [`_stream_id` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#_stream_id-filter). For example, `_stream_id:in(_time:5m error | fields _stream_id)` returns logs for [logs streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) with the `error` word across logs for the last 5 minutes.

## [v0.21.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.21.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-20

* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add a bar chart displaying the number of log entries over a time range. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6404).
* FEATURE: expose `_stream_id` field, which uniquely identifies [log streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields). This field can be used for quick obtaining of all the logs belonging to a particular stream via [`_stream_id` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#_stream_id-filter).

## [v0.20.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.20.2-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-18

* BUGFIX: properly parse timestamps with nanosecond precision for logs ingested via [jsonline format](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#json-stream-api). The bug has been introduced in [v0.20.0 release](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.20.0-victorialogs).

## [v0.20.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.20.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-18

* FEATURE: allow configuring multiple receivers with distinct configs for syslog messages. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/#multiple-configs).

* BUGFIX: properly read syslog messages over TCP and TLS connections according to [RFC5425](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5425) when [data ingestion for syslog protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/) is enabled.

## [v0.20.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.20.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-17

* FEATURE: add ability to accept logs in [Syslog format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/syslog/).
* FEATURE: add ability to specify timezone offset when parsing [rfc3164](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3164) syslog messages with [`unpack_syslog` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_syslog-pipe).
* FEATURE: add [`top` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#top-pipe) for returning top N sets of the given fields with the maximum number of matching log entries.

## [v0.19.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.19.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-11

* FEATURE: do not allow starting the [filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filters) with [pipe names](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pipes) and [stats function names](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe-functions). This prevents from unexpected results returned by incorrect queries, which miss mandatory [filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#query-syntax).
* FEATURE: treat unexpected syslog message as [RFC3164](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3164) containing only the `message` field when using [`unpack_syslog` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_syslog-pipe).
* FEATURE: allow using `where` prefix instead of `filter` prefix in [`filter` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filter-pipe).
* FEATURE: disallow unescaped `!` char in [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) queries, since it permits writing incorrect query, which may look like correct one. For example, `foo!:bar` instead of `foo:!bar`.
* FEATURE: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): add markdown support to the `Group` view. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6292).

* FEATURE: add support for [day range filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#day-range-filter) and [week range filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#week-range-filter). These filters allow selecting logs on a particular time range per every day or on a particular day of the week.
* FEATURE: allow using `eval` instead of `math` keyword in [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe).

## [v0.17.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.17.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-05

* FEATURE: add [`pack_logfmt` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pack_logfmt-pipe) for formatting [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) into [logfmt](https://brandur.org/logfmt) messages.
* FEATURE: allow using IPv4 addresses in [range comparison filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#range-comparison-filter). For example, `ip:>'12.34.56.78'` is valid filter now.
* FEATURE: add `ceil()` and `floor()` functions to [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe).
* FEATURE: add support for bitwise `and`, `or` and `xor` operations at [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe).
* FEATURE: add support for automatic conversion of [RFC3339 time](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) and IPv4 addresses into numeric representation at [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe).
* FEATURE: add ability to format numeric fields into string representation of time, duration and IPv4 with [`format` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#format-pipe).
* FEATURE: set `format` field to `rfc3164` or `rfc5424` depending on the [Syslog format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) parsed via [`unpack_syslog` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_syslog-pipe).

* BUGFIX: always respect the limit set in [`limit` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#limit-pipe). Previously the limit could be exceeded in some cases.

## [v0.16.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.16.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-06-04

* FEATURE: add [`unpack_syslog` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_syslog-pipe) for unpacking [syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) messages from [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: parse timestamps in [`_time` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter) with nanosecond precision.
* FEATURE: return the last `N` matching logs from [`/select/logsql/query` HTTP API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-logs) with the maximum timestamps if `limit=N` query arg is passed to it. Previously a random subset of matching logs could be returned, which could complicate investigation of the returned logs.
* FEATURE: add [`drop_empty_fields` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#drop_empty_fields-pipe) for dropping [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) with empty values.

## [v0.15.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.15.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-05-30

* FEATURE: add [`row_any`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#row_any-stats) function for [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe). This function returns a sample log entry per every calculated [group of results](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-by-fields).
* FEATURE: add `default` operator to [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe). It allows overriding `NaN` results with the given default value.
* FEATURE: add `exp()` and `ln()` functions to [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe).
* FEATURE: allow omitting result name in [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe) expresions. In this case the result name is automatically set to string representation of the corresponding math expression. For example, `_time:5m | math duration / 1000` is equivalent to `_time:5m | math (duration / 1000) as "duration / 1000"`.
* FEATURE: allow omitting result name in [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe). In this case the result name is automatically set to string representation of the corresponding [stats function expression](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe-functions). For example, `_time:5m | count(*)` is valid [LogsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) now. It is equivalent to `_time:5m | stats count(*) as "count(*)"`.

* BUGFIX: properly calculate the number of matching rows in `* | field_values x | stats count() rows` and in `* | unroll (x) | stats count() rows` queries.

## [v0.14.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.14.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-05-29

* FEATURE: allow specifying fields, which must be packed into JSON in [`pack_json` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pack_json-pipe) via `pack_json fields (field1, ..., fieldN)` syntax.

* BUGFIX: properly apply `if (...)` filters to calculated results in [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) when [grouping by fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-by-fields) is enabled. For example, `_time:5m | stats by (host) count() logs, count() if (error) errors` now properly calculates per-`host` `errors`.

## [v0.13.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.13.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-05-28

* FEATURE: add [`extract_regexp` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#extract_regexp-pipe) for extracting arbitrary substrings from [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) with [RE2 regular expressions](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).
* FEATURE: add [`math` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#math-pipe) for mathematical calculations over [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: add [`field_values` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#field_values-pipe), which returns unique values for the given [log field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: allow omitting `stats` prefix in [`stats` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe). For example, `_time:5m | count() rows` is a valid query now. It is equivalent to `_time:5m | stats count() as rows`.
* FEATURE: allow omitting `filter` prefix in [`filter` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filter-pipe) if the filter doesn't clash with [pipe names](#https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pipes). For example, `_time:5m | stats by (host) count() rows | rows:>1000` is a valid query now. It is equivalent to `_time:5m | stats by (host) count() rows | filter rows:>1000`.
* FEATURE: allow [`head` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#limit-pipe) without number. For example, `error | head`. In this case 10 first values are returned as `head` Unix command does by default.
* FEATURE: allow using [comparison filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#range-comparison-filter) with strings. For example, `some_text_field:>="foo"` matches [log entries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) with `some_text_field` field values bigger or equal to `foo`.

## [v0.12.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.12.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-05-26

* FEATURE: add support for comments in multi-line LogsQL queries. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#comments).

This bug has been introduced in [v0.12.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.12.0-victorialogs).

## [v0.12.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.12.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-05-26

* FEATURE: add [`pack_json` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#pack_json-pipe), which packs all the [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) into a JSON object and stores it into the given field.
* FEATURE: add [`unroll` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unroll-pipe), which can be used for unrolling JSON arrays stored in [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
* FEATURE: add [`replace_regexp` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#replace_regexp-pipe), which allows updating [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) with regular expressions.

* FEATURE: improve performance for [`/select/logsql/field_names` HTTP API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#querying-field-names).

* BUGFIX: prevent from panic in [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe) when VictoriaLogs runs on a system with one CPU core.
* BUGFIX: do not return referenced fields if they weren't present in the original logs. For example, `_time:5m | format if (non_existing_field:"") "abc"` could return empty `non_exiting_field`, while it shouldn't be returned because it is missing in the original logs.
* BUGFIX: properly initialize values for [`in(...)` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#multi-exact-filter) inside [`filter` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filter-pipe) if the `in(...)` contains other [filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filters). For example, `_time:5m | filter ip:in(user_type:admin | fields ip)` now works correctly.

## [v0.11.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.11.0-victorialogs)

* FEATURE: support [comparing](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#range-filter) log field values with [special numeric values](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#numeric-values). For example, `duration:>1.5s` and `response_size:<15KiB` are valid filters now.
* FEATURE: properly sort [durations](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#duration-values) and [short numeric values](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#short-numeric-values) in [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe). For example, `10s` goes in front of `1h`, while `10KB` goes in front of `1GB`.
* FEATURE: add an ability to preserve the original non-empty field values when executing [`extract`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#extract-pipe), [`unpack_json`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_json-pipe), [`unpack_logfmt`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_logfmt-pipe) and [`format`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#format-pipe) pipes.
* FEATURE: add an ability to preserve the original field values if the corresponding unpacked values are empty when executing [`extract`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#extract-pipe), [`unpack_json`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_json-pipe), [`unpack_logfmt`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#unpack_logfmt-pipe) and [`format`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#format-pipe) pipes.

Released at 2024-05-24

* FEATURE: return the number of matching log entries per returned value in [HTTP API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api) results. This simplifies detecting [field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) / [stream](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) values with the biggest number of logs for the given [LogsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/).
* FEATURE: improve performance for [regexp filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#regexp-filter) in the following cases:
  * If the regexp contains just a phrase without special regular expression chars. For example, `~"foo"`.
  * If the regexp starts with `.*` or ends with `.*`. For example, `~".*foo.*"`.
  * If the regexp contains multiple strings delimited by `|`. For example, `~"foo|bar|baz"`.
  * If the regexp contains multiple [words](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#word). For example, `~"foo bar baz"`.
* FEATURE: allow disabling automatic unquoting of the matched placeholders in [`extract` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#extract-pipe). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#format-for-extract-pipe-pattern).

* BUGFIX: properly parse `!` in front of [exact filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#exact-filter), [exact-prefix filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#exact-prefix-filter) and [regexp filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#regexp-filter). For example, `!~"some regexp"` is properly parsed as `not ="some regexp"`. Previously it was incorrectly parsed as `'~="some regexp"'` [phrase filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#phrase-filter).
* BUGFIX: properly sort results by [`_time` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field) when [`limit` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#limit-pipe) is applied. For example, `_time:5m | sort by (_time) desc | limit 10` properly works now.

* BUGFIX: properly return matching logs in [streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) with small number of entries. Previously they could be skipped. The issue has been introduced in [the release v0.6.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.6.0-victorialogs).
* BUGFIX: fix `runtime error: index out of range` panic when using [`sort` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe) like `_time:1h | sort by (_time)`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6258).

## [v0.6.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.6.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-05-12

* FEATURE: return all the log fields by default in query results. Previously only [`_stream`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields), [`_time`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field) and [`_msg`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field) fields were returned by default.
* FEATURE: add support for returning only the requested log [fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#fields-pipe).
* FEATURE: add support for calculating various stats over [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model). Grouping by arbitrary set of [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) is supported. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stats-pipe) for details.
* FEATURE: add support for sorting the returned results. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#sort-pipe).
* FEATURE: add support for returning unique results. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#uniq-pipe).
* FEATURE: add support for limiting the number of returned results. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#limiters).
* FEATURE: add support for copying and renaming the selected log fields. See [these](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#copy-pipe) and [these](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#rename-pipe) docs.
* FEATURE: allow using `_` inside numbers. For example, `score:range[1_000, 5_000_000]` for [`range` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#range-filter).
* FEATURE: allow numbers in hexadecimal and binary form. For example, `response_size:range[0xff, 0b10001101101]` for [`range` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#range-filter).
* FEATURE: allow using duration and byte size suffixes in numeric values inside LogsQL queries. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#numeric-values).
* FEATURE: improve data ingestion performance by up to 50%.
* FEATURE: optimize performance for [LogsQL query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/), which contains multiple filters for [words](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#word-filter) or [phrases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#phrase-filter) delimited with [`AND` operator](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#logical-filter). For example, `foo AND bar` query must find [log messages](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field) with `foo` and `bar` words at faster speed.

* BUGFIX: prevent from possible corruption of short [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) during data ingestion.
* BUGFIX: prevent from additional CPU usage for up to a few seconds after canceling the query.
* BUGFIX: prevent from returning log entries with emtpy `_stream` field in the form `"_stream":""` in [search query results](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6042).

## [v0.5.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.5.2-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-04-11

* BUGFIX: properly register new [log streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) under high data ingestion rate. The issue has been introduced in [v0.5.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.5.0-victorialogs).

## [v0.5.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.5.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-04-04

* BUGFIX: do not log debug lines `DEBUG: start trimLines` and `DEBUG: end trimLines`. This bug has been introduced in [v0.5.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.5.0-victorialogs) in [this commit](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/commit/0514091948cf8e00e42f44318c0e5e5b63b6388f).

## [v0.5.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.5.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2024-03-01

* FEATURE: support the ability to limit the number of returned log entries from [HTTP querying API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api) by passing `limit` query arg. Previously all the matching log entries were returned until closing the response stream. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5674). Thanks to @dmitryk-dk for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5778).

* BUGFIX: do not panic on incorrect regular expression in [stream filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream-filter). Thanks to @XLONG96 for [the bugfix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5897).
* BUGFIX: properly determine when the assisted merge is needed. Previously the logs for determining whether the assisted merge is needed was broken. This could lead to too big number of parts under high data ingestion rate. Thanks to @lujiajing1126 for [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5447).
* BUGFIX: properly stop execution of aborted query when the query doesn't contain [`_stream` filter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream-filter). Previously such a query could continue consuming resources after being aborted by the client. Thanks to @z-anshun for [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5400).

## [v0.4.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.4.2-victorialogs)

Released at 2023-11-15

* BUGFIX: properly locate logs for the [requested streams](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream-filter). Previously logs for some streams may be missing in query results. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4856). Thanks to @XLONG96 for [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5295)!
* BUGFIX: [web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui): properly sort found logs by time. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5300).

## [v0.4.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.4.1-victorialogs)

Released at 2023-10-04

* BUGFIX: fix the free space verification process in VictoriaLogs that was erroneously shifting to read-only mode, despite there being sufficient free space available. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5112) issue.

## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.4.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2023-10-03

* FEATURE: add `-elasticsearch.version` command-line flag, which can be used for specifying Elasticsearch version returned by VictoriaLogs to Filebeat at [elasticsearch bulk API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#elasticsearch-bulk-api). This helps resolving [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4777).
* FEATURE: expose the following metrics at [/metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#monitoring) page:
  * `vl_data_size_bytes{type="storage"}` - on-disk size for data excluding [log stream](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) indexes.
  * `vl_data_size_bytes{type="indexdb"}` - on-disk size for [log stream](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#stream-fields) indexes.
* FEATURE: add `-insert.maxFieldsPerLine` command-line flag, which can be used for limiting the number of fields per line in logs sent to VictoriaLogs via ingestion protocols. This helps to avoid issues like [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4762).
* FEATURE: expose `vl_http_request_duration_seconds` histogram at the [/metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#monitoring) page. Thanks to @crossoverJie for [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/4934).
* FEATURE: add support of `-storage.minFreeDiskSpaceBytes` command-line flag to allow switching to read-only mode when running out of disk space at `-storageDataPath`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4737).

* BUGFIX: fix possible panic when no data is written to VictoriaLogs for a long time. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4895). Thanks to @crossoverJie for filing and fixing the issue.
* BUGFIX: add `/insert/loki/ready` endpoint, which is used by Promtail for healthchecks. This should remove `unsupported path requested: /insert/loki/ready` warning logs. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4762#issuecomment-1690966722).
* BUGFIX: prevent from panic during background merge when the number of columns in the resulting block exceeds the maximum allowed number of columns per block. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4762).

## [v0.3.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.3.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2023-07-20

* FEATURE: add support for data ingestion via Promtail (aka default log shipper for Grafana Loki). See [these](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/promtail/) and [these](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/#loki-json-api) docs.

## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v0.2.0-victorialogs)

Released at 2023-07-17

* FEATURE: support short form of `_time` filters over the last X minutes/hours/days/etc. For example, `_time:5m` is a short form for `_time:(now-5m, now]`, which matches logs with [timestamps](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field) for the last 5 minutes. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter) for details.
* FEATURE: add ability to specify offset for the selected time range. For example, `_time:5m offset 1h` is equivalent to `_time:(now-5m-1h, now-1h]`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#time-filter) for details.
* FEATURE: [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/): replace `exact_prefix("...")` with `exact("..."*)`. This makes it consistent with [i()](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#case-insensitive-filter) filter, which can accept phrases and prefixes, e.g. `i("phrase")` and `i("phrase"*)`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#exact-prefix-filter).
