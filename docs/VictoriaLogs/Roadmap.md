# VictoriaLogs roadmap

The [VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/) Preview is ready for evaluation in production.
It is recommended running it alongside the existing solutions such as Elasticsearch and Grafana Loki
and comparing their resource usage and usability.
It isn't recommended migrating from existing solutions to VictoriaLogs Preview yet.

The following functionality is available in VictoriaLogs Preview:

- [Data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/data-ingestion/).
- [Querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/querying/).
- [Querying via command-line](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/querying/#command-line).

See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/) for details.

The following functionality is planned in the future versions of VictoriaLogs:

- Support for [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/data-ingestion/) from popular log collectors and formats:
  - Fluentd
  - Syslog
  - Journald (systemd)
- Add missing functionality to [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/LogsQL.html):
  - [Stream context](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/LogsQL.html#stream-context).
  - [Transformation functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/LogsQL.html#transformations).

- Live tailing for [LogsQL filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/LogsQL.html#filters) aka `tail -f`.

  - Build graphs over time for the ingested logs.
- Integration with Grafana.
