# VictoriaLogs

VictoriaLogs is [open source](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/app/victoria-logs) user-friendly database for logs
from [VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/).

VictoriaLogs provides the following features:

- VictoriaLogs can accept logs from popular log collectors. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/).
- VictoriaLogs is much easier to set up and operate compared to Elasticsearch and Grafana Loki.
  See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/quickstart/).
- VictoriaLogs provides easy yet powerful query language with full-text search capabilities across
  all the [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) -
  see [LogsQL docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/).
- VictoriaLogs can be seamlessly combined with good old Unix tools for log analysis such as `grep`, `less`, `sort`, `jq`, etc.
  See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#command-line) for details.
- VictoriaLogs capacity and performance scales linearly with the available resources (CPU, RAM, disk IO, disk space).
  It runs smoothly on both Raspberry PI and a server with hundreds of CPU cores and terabytes of RAM.
- VictoriaLogs can handle up to 30x bigger data volumes than Elasticsearch and Grafana Loki when running on the same hardware.
  See [these docs](#benchmarks).
- VictoriaLogs supports fast full-text search over high-cardinality [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model)
  such as `trace_id`, `user_id` and `ip`.
- VictoriaLogs supports multitenancy - see [these docs](#multitenancy).
- VictoriaLogs supports out-of-order logs' ingestion aka backfilling.
- VictoriaLogs provides a simple web UI for querying logs - see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui).

VictoriaLogs is at the Preview stage now. It is ready for evaluation in production and verifying the claims given above.
It isn't recommended to migrate from existing logging solutions to VictoriaLogs Preview in general cases yet.
See the [Roadmap](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/roadmap/) for details.

If you have questions about VictoriaLogs, then read [this FAQ](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/faq/).
Also feel free asking any questions at [VictoriaMetrics community Slack chat](https://victoriametrics.slack.com/), 
you can join it via [Slack Inviter](https://slack.victoriametrics.com/).

See [Quick start docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/quickstart/) for start working with VictoriaLogs.

## Monitoring

VictoriaLogs exposes internal metrics in Prometheus exposition format at `http://localhost:9428/metrics` page.
It is recommended to set up monitoring of these metrics via VictoriaMetrics
(see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-scrape-prometheus-exporters-such-as-node-exporter)),
vmagent (see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#how-to-collect-metrics-in-prometheus-format)) or via Prometheus.

VictoriaLogs emits its own logs to stdout. It is recommended to investigate these logs during troubleshooting.

## Upgrading

It is safe upgrading VictoriaLogs to new versions unless [release notes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/changelog/) say otherwise.
It is safe to skip multiple versions during the upgrade unless [release notes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/changelog/) say otherwise.
It is recommended to perform regular upgrades to the latest version, since it may contain important bug fixes, performance optimizations or new features.

It is also safe to downgrade to older versions unless [release notes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/changelog/) say otherwise.

The following steps must be performed during the upgrade / downgrade procedure:

* Send `SIGINT` signal to VictoriaLogs process in order to gracefully stop it.
  See [how to send signals to processes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33239959/send-signal-to-process-from-command-line).
* Wait until the process stops. This can take a few seconds.
* Start the upgraded VictoriaLogs.

## Retention

By default VictoriaLogs stores log entries with timestamps in the time range `[now-7d, now]`, while dropping logs outside the given time range.
E.g. it uses the retention of 7 days. The retention can be configured with `-retentionPeriod` command-line flag.
This flag accepts values starting from `1d` (one day) up to `100y` (100 years). See [these docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-durations)
for the supported duration formats.

For example, the following command starts VictoriaLogs with the retention of 8 weeks:

```sh
/path/to/victoria-logs -retentionPeriod=8w
```

VictoriaLogs stores the [ingested](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/) logs in per-day partition directories.
It automatically drops partition directories outside the configured retention.

VictoriaLogs automatically drops logs at [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/) stage
if they have timestamps outside the configured retention. A sample of dropped logs is logged with `WARN` message in order to simplify troubleshooting.
The `vl_rows_dropped_total` [metric](#monitoring) is incremented each time an ingested log entry is dropped because of timestamp outside the retention.
It is recommended to set up the following alerting rule at [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/) in order to be notified
when logs with wrong timestamps are ingested into VictoriaLogs:

```metricsql
rate(vl_rows_dropped_total[5m]) > 0
```

By default, VictoriaLogs doesn't accept log entries with timestamps bigger than `now+2d`, e.g. 2 days in the future.
If you need accepting logs with bigger timestamps, then specify the desired "future retention" via `-futureRetention` command-line flag.
This flag accepts values starting from `1d`. See [these docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-durations)
for the supported duration formats.

For example, the following command starts VictoriaLogs, which accepts logs with timestamps up to a year in the future:

```sh
/path/to/victoria-logs -futureRetention=1y
```

## Storage

VictoriaLogs stores all its data in a single directory - `victoria-logs-data`. The path to the directory can be changed via `-storageDataPath` command-line flag.
For example, the following command starts VictoriaLogs, which stores the data at `/var/lib/victoria-logs`:

```sh
/path/to/victoria-logs -storageDataPath=/var/lib/victoria-logs
```

VictoriaLogs automatically creates the `-storageDataPath` directory on the first run if it is missing.

## Multitenancy

VictoriaLogs supports multitenancy. A tenant is identified by `(AccountID, ProjectID)` pair, where `AccountID` and `ProjectID` are arbitrary 32-bit unsigned integers.
The `AccountID` and `ProjectID` fields can be set during [data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/)
and [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/) via `AccountID` and `ProjectID` request headers.

If `AccountID` and/or `ProjectID` request headers aren't set, then the default `0` value is used.

VictoriaLogs has very low overhead for per-tenant management, so it is OK to have thousands of tenants in a single VictoriaLogs instance.

VictoriaLogs doesn't perform per-tenant authorization. Use [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/) or similar tools for per-tenant authorization.

## Benchmarks

Here is a [benchmark suite](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/logs-benchmark) for comparing data ingestion performance
and resource usage between VictoriaLogs and Elasticsearch or Loki.

It is recommended [setting up VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/quickstart/) in production alongside the existing
log management systems and comparing resource usage + query performance between VictoriaLogs and your system such as Elasticsearch or Grafana Loki.

Please share benchmark results and ideas on how to improve benchmarks / VictoriaLogs
via [VictoriaMetrics community channels](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#community-and-contributions).

## List of command-line flags

Pass `-help` to VictoriaLogs in order to see the list of supported command-line flags with their description:

```
  -blockcache.missesBeforeCaching int
    	The number of cache misses before putting the block into cache. Higher values may reduce indexdb/dataBlocks cache size at the cost of higher CPU and disk read usage (default 2)
  -cacheExpireDuration duration
    	Items are removed from in-memory caches after they aren't accessed for this duration. Lower values may reduce memory usage at the cost of higher CPU usage. See also -prevCacheRemovalPercent (default 30m0s)
  -elasticsearch.version string
    	Elasticsearch version to report to client (default "8.9.0")
  -enableTCP6
    	Whether to enable IPv6 for listening and dialing. By default, only IPv4 TCP and UDP are used
  -envflag.enable
    	Whether to enable reading flags from environment variables in addition to the command line. Command line flag values have priority over values from environment vars. Flags are read only from the command line if this flag isn't set. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#environment-variables for more details
  -envflag.prefix string
    	Prefix for environment variables if -envflag.enable is set
  -filestream.disableFadvise
    	Whether to disable fadvise() syscall when reading large data files. The fadvise() syscall prevents from eviction of recently accessed data from OS page cache during background merges and backups. In some rare cases it is better to disable the syscall if it uses too much CPU
  -flagsAuthKey value
    	Auth key for /flags endpoint. It must be passed via authKey query arg. It overrides httpAuth.* settings
    	Flag value can be read from the given file when using -flagsAuthKey=file:///abs/path/to/file or -flagsAuthKey=file://./relative/path/to/file . Flag value can be read from the given http/https url when using -flagsAuthKey=http://host/path or -flagsAuthKey=https://host/path
  -fs.disableMmap
    	Whether to use pread() instead of mmap() for reading data files. By default, mmap() is used for 64-bit arches and pread() is used for 32-bit arches, since they cannot read data files bigger than 2^32 bytes in memory. mmap() is usually faster for reading small data chunks than pread()
  -futureRetention value
    	Log entries with timestamps bigger than now+futureRetention are rejected during data ingestion; see https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#retention
    	The following optional suffixes are supported: s (second), m (minute), h (hour), d (day), w (week), y (year). If suffix isn't set, then the duration is counted in months (default 2d)
  -http.connTimeout duration
    	Incoming connections to -httpListenAddr are closed after the configured timeout. This may help evenly spreading load among a cluster of services behind TCP-level load balancer. Zero value disables closing of incoming connections (default 2m0s)
  -http.disableResponseCompression
    	Disable compression of HTTP responses to save CPU resources. By default, compression is enabled to save network bandwidth
  -http.header.csp string
    	Value for 'Content-Security-Policy' header, recommended: "default-src 'self'"

    	Timeout for incoming idle http connections (default 1m0s)
  -http.maxGracefulShutdownDuration duration
    	The maximum duration for a graceful shutdown of the HTTP server. A highly loaded server may require increased value for a graceful shutdown (default 7s)
  -http.pathPrefix string
    	An optional prefix to add to all the paths handled by http server. For example, if '-http.pathPrefix=/foo/bar' is set, then all the http requests will be handled on '/foo/bar/*' paths. This may be useful for proxied requests. See https://www.robustperception.io/using-external-urls-and-proxies-with-prometheus
  -http.shutdownDelay duration
    	Optional delay before http server shutdown. During this delay, the server returns non-OK responses from /health page, so load balancers can route new requests to other servers
  -httpAuth.password value
    	Password for HTTP server's Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if -httpAuth.username is empty
    	Flag value can be read from the given file when using -httpAuth.password=file:///abs/path/to/file or -httpAuth.password=file://./relative/path/to/file . Flag value can be read from the given http/https url when using -httpAuth.password=http://host/path or -httpAuth.password=https://host/path
  -httpAuth.username string

    	Empty values are set to false.
  -inmemoryDataFlushInterval duration
    	The interval for guaranteed saving of in-memory data to disk. The saved data survives unclean shutdowns such as OOM crash, hardware reset, SIGKILL, etc. Bigger intervals may help increase the lifetime of flash storage with limited write cycles (e.g. Raspberry PI). Smaller intervals increase disk IO load. Minimum supported value is 1s (default 5s)
  -insert.maxFieldsPerLine int
    	The maximum number of log fields per line, which can be read by /insert/* handlers (default 1000)
  -insert.maxLineSizeBytes size
    	The maximum size of a single line, which can be read by /insert/* handlers

  -maxConcurrentInserts int
    	The maximum number of concurrent insert requests. Set higher value when clients send data over slow networks. Default value depends on the number of available CPU cores. It should work fine in most cases since it minimizes resource usage. See also -insert.maxQueueDuration (default 32)
  -memory.allowedBytes size
    	Allowed size of system memory VictoriaMetrics caches may occupy. This option overrides -memory.allowedPercent if set to a non-zero value.
