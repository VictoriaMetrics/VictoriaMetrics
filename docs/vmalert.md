# vmalert

`vmalert` executes a list of the given [alerting](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/)
or [recording](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/)
rules against configured `-datasource.url` compatible with Prometheus HTTP API. For sending alerting notifications
vmalert relies on [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) configured via `-notifier.url` flag.
Recording rules results are persisted via [remote write](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#remote-storage-integrations)
protocol and require `-remoteWrite.url` to be configured.
Vmalert is heavily inspired by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/overview/)
implementation and aims to be compatible with its syntax.

A [single-node](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#vmalert)
or [cluster version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#vmalert)
of VictoriaMetrics are capable of proxying requests to vmalert via `-vmalert.proxyURL` command-line flag. 
Use this feature for the following cases:
* for proxying requests from [Grafana Alerting UI](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/);
* for accessing vmalerts UI through VictoriaMetrics Web interface.

## Features

* Integration with [VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics) TSDB;
* VictoriaMetrics [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html)
  support and expressions validation;
* Prometheus [alerting rules definition format](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/#defining-alerting-rules)
  support;
* Integration with [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) starting from [Alertmanager v0.16.0-alpha](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/tag/v0.16.0-alpha.0);
* Keeps the alerts [state on restarts](#alerts-state-on-restarts);
* Graphite datasource can be used for alerting and recording rules. See [these docs](#graphite);
* Recording and Alerting rules backfilling (aka `replay`). See [these docs](#rules-backfilling);
* Lightweight and without extra dependencies.
* Supports [reusable templates](#reusable-templates) for annotations;
* Load of recording and alerting rules from local filesystem, URL, GCS and S3;
* Detect alerting rules which [don't match any series](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4039).

## Limitations

* `vmalert` execute queries against remote datasource which has reliability risks because of the network.
  It is recommended to configure alerts thresholds and rules expressions with the understanding that network
  requests may fail;
* by default, rules execution is sequential within one group, but persistence of execution results to remote
  storage is asynchronous. Hence, user shouldn't rely on chaining of recording rules when result of previous
  recording rule is reused in the next one;

## QuickStart

To build `vmalert` from sources:

```console
git clone https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics
cd VictoriaMetrics
make vmalert
```

The build binary will be placed in `VictoriaMetrics/bin` folder.

To start using `vmalert` you will need the following things:

* list of rules - PromQL/MetricsQL expressions to execute;
* datasource address - reachable endpoint with [Prometheus HTTP API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#http-api) support for running queries against;
* notifier address [optional] - reachable [Alert Manager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) instance for processing,
  aggregating alerts, and sending notifications. Please note, notifier address also supports Consul and DNS Service Discovery via
  [config file](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmalert/notifier/config.go).
* remote write address [optional] - [remote write](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#remote-storage-integrations)
  compatible storage to persist rules and alerts state info. To persist results to multiple destinations use vmagent
  configured with multiple remote writes as a proxy;
* remote read address [optional] - MetricsQL compatible datasource to restore alerts state from.

Then configure `vmalert` accordingly:

```console
./bin/vmalert -rule=alert.rules \            # Path to the file with rules configuration. Supports wildcard
    -datasource.url=http://localhost:8428 \  # Prometheus HTTP API compatible datasource
    -notifier.url=http://localhost:9093 \    # AlertManager URL (required if alerting rules are used)
    -notifier.url=http://127.0.0.1:9093 \    # AlertManager replica URL
    -remoteWrite.url=http://localhost:8428 \ # Remote write compatible storage to persist rules and alerts state info (required if recording rules are used)
    -remoteRead.url=http://localhost:8428 \  # Prometheus HTTP API compatible datasource to restore alerts state from
    -external.label=cluster=east-1 \         # External label to be applied for each rule
    -external.label=replica=a                # Multiple external labels may be set
```

Note there's a separate `-remoteWrite.url` command-line flag to allow writing results of
alerting/recording rules into a different storage than the initial data that's
queried. This allows using `vmalert` to aggregate data from a short-term,
high-frequency, high-cardinality storage into a long-term storage with
decreased cardinality and a bigger interval between samples.
See also [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation.html).

See the full list of configuration flags in [configuration](#configuration) section.

If you run multiple `vmalert` services for the same datastore or AlertManager - do not forget
to specify different `-external.label` command-line flags in order to define which `vmalert` generated rules or alerts.
If rule result metrics have label that conflict with `-external.label`, `vmalert` will automatically rename
it with prefix `exported_`.

Configuration for [recording](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/)
and [alerting](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/) rules is very
similar to Prometheus rules and configured using YAML. Configuration examples may be found
in [testdata](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmalert/config/testdata) folder.
Every `rule` belongs to a `group` and every configuration file may contain arbitrary number of groups:

```yaml
groups:
  [ - <rule_group> ]
```

### Groups

Each group has the following attributes:

```yaml
# The name of the group. Must be unique within a file.
name: <string>

# How often rules in the group are evaluated.
[ interval: <duration> | default = -evaluationInterval flag ]

# Optional
# Group will be evaluated at the exact offset in the range of [0...interval].
# E.g. for Group with `interval: 1h` and `eval_offset: 5m` the evaluation will
# start at 5th minute of the hour. See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3409
# `eval_offset` can't be bigger than `interval`.
[ eval_offset: <duration> ]

# Optional
# Adjust the `time` parameter of group evaluation requests to compensate intentional query delay from the datasource.
# By default, the value is inherited from the `-rule.evalDelay` cmd-line flag - see its description for details.
# If group has `latency_offset` set in `params`, then it is recommended to set `eval_delay` equal to `latency_offset`.
# See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5155 and https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#query-latency.
[ eval_delay: <duration> ]

# Limit the number of alerts an alerting rule and series a recording
# rule can produce. 0 is no limit.
[ limit: <int> | default = 0 ]

# How many rules execute at once within a group. Increasing concurrency may speed
# up group's evaluation duration (exposed via `vmalert_iteration_duration_seconds` metric).
[ concurrency: <integer> | default = 1 ]

# Optional type for expressions inside the rules. Supported values: "graphite" and "prometheus".
# By default, "prometheus" type is used.
[ type: <string> ]

# Optional
# The evaluation timestamp will be aligned with group's interval, 
# instead of using the actual timestamp that evaluation happens at.
# By default, it's enabled to get more predictable results 
# and to visually align with results plotted via Grafana or vmui.
# See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5049 
# Available starting from v1.95
[ eval_alignment: <bool> | default true]

# Optional list of HTTP URL parameters
# applied for all rules requests within a group
# For example:
#  params:
#    nocache: ["1"]                # disable caching for vmselect
#    denyPartialResponse: ["true"] # fail if one or more vmstorage nodes returned an error
#    extra_label: ["env=dev"]      # apply additional label filter "env=dev" for all requests
# see more details at https://docs.victoriametrics.com#prometheus-querying-api-enhancements
params:
  [ <string>: [<string>, ...]]

# Optional list of HTTP headers in form `header-name: value`
# applied for all rules requests within a group
# For example:
#  headers:
#    - "CustomHeader: foo"
#    - "CustomHeader2: bar"
# Headers set via this param have priority over headers set via `-datasource.headers` flag.
headers:
  [ <string>, ...]

# Optional list of HTTP headers in form `header-name: value`
# applied for all alert notifications sent to notifiers 
# generated by rules of this group.
# For example:
#  notifier_headers:
#    - "TenantID: foo"
notifier_headers:
        [ <string>, ...]

# Optional list of labels added to every rule within a group.
# It has priority over the external labels.
# Labels are commonly used for adding environment
# or tenant-specific tag.
labels:
  [ <labelname>: <labelvalue> ... ]

rules:
  [ - <rule> ... ]
```

### Rules

Every rule contains `expr` field for [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/)
or [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html) expression. `vmalert` will execute the configured
expression and then act according to the Rule type.

There are two types of Rules:

* [alerting](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/) -
  Alerting rules allow defining alert conditions via `expr` field and to send notifications to
  [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) if execution result is not empty.
* [recording](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/) -
  Recording rules allow defining `expr` which result will be then backfilled to configured
  `-remoteWrite.url`. Recording rules are used to precompute frequently needed or computationally
  expensive expressions and save their result as a new set of time series.

`vmalert` forbids defining duplicates - rules with the same combination of name, expression, and labels
within one group.

#### Alerting rules

The syntax for alerting rule is the following:

```yaml
# The name of the alert. Must be a valid metric name.
alert: <string>

# The expression to evaluate. The expression language depends on the type value.
# By default, PromQL/MetricsQL expression is used. If group.type="graphite", then the expression
# must contain valid Graphite expression.
expr: <string>

# Alerts are considered firing once they have been returned for this long.
# Alerts which have not yet been fired for long enough are considered pending.
# If param is omitted or set to 0 then alerts will be immediately considered
# as firing once they return.
[ for: <duration> | default = 0s ]

# Alert will continue firing for this long even when the alerting expression no longer has results.
# This allows you to delay alert resolution.
[ keep_firing_for: <duration> | default = 0s ]

# Whether to print debug information into logs.
# Information includes alerts state changes and requests sent to the datasource.
# Please note, that if rule's query params contain sensitive
# information - it will be printed to logs.
# Is applicable to alerting rules only.
# Available starting from https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1820
[ debug: <bool> | default = false ]

# Defines the number of rule's updates entries stored in memory
# and available for view on rule's Details page.
# Overrides `rule.updateEntriesLimit` value for this specific rule.
# Available starting from https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1860
[ update_entries_limit: <integer> | default 0 ]

# Labels to add or overwrite for each alert.
labels:
  [ <labelname>: <tmpl_string> ]

# Annotations to add to each alert.
annotations:
  [ <labelname>: <tmpl_string> ]
```

#### Templating

It is allowed to use [Go templating](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) in annotations to format data, iterate over
or execute expressions.
The following variables are available in templating:

| Variable                           | Description                                                                                               | Example                                                                                                                                                                |

Additionally, `vmalert` provides some extra templating functions listed [here](#template-functions) and [reusable templates](#reusable-templates).

#### Template functions

`vmalert` provides the following template functions, which can be used during [templating](#templating):

- `args arg0 ... argN` - converts the input args into a map with `arg0`, ..., `argN` keys.
- `externalURL` - returns the value of `-external.url` command-line flag.
- `first` - returns the first result from the input query results returned by `query` function.
- `htmlEscape` - escapes special chars in input string, so it can be safely embedded as a plaintext into HTML.
- `humanize` - converts the input number into human-readable format by adding [metric prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix).
  For example, `100000` is converted into `100K`.
- `humanize1024` - converts the input number into human-readable format with 1024 base.
  For example, `1024` is converted into 1ki`.
- `humanizeDuration` - converts the input number in seconds into human-readable duration.
- `humanizePercentage` - converts the input number to percentage. For example, `0.123` is converted into `12.3%`.
- `humanizeTimestamp` - converts the input unix timestamp into human-readable time.
- `jsonEscape` - JSON-encodes the input string.
- `label name` - returns the value of the label with the given `name` from the input query result.
- `match regex` - matches the input string against the provided `regex`.
- `parseDuration` - parses the input string into duration in seconds. For example, `1h` is parsed into `3600`.
- `parseDurationTime` - parses the input string into [time.Duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration).
- `pathEscape` - escapes the input string, so it can be safely put inside path part of URL.
- `pathPrefix` - returns the path part of the `-external.url` command-line flag.
- `query` - executes the [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html) query against `-datasource.url` and returns the query result.
  For example, {% raw %}`{{ query "sort_desc(process_resident_memory_bytes)" | first | value }}`{% endraw %} executes the `sort_desc(process_resident_memory_bytes)`
  query at `-datasource.url` and returns the first result.
- `queryEscape` - escapes the input string, so it can be safely put inside [query arg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) part of URL.
- `quotesEscape` - escapes the input string, so it can be safely embedded into JSON string.
- `reReplaceAll regex repl` - replaces all the occurrences of the `regex` in input string with the `repl`.
- `safeHtml` - marks the input string as safe to use in HTML context without the need to html-escape it.
- `sortByLabel name` - sorts the input query results by the label with the given `name`.
- `stripDomain` - leaves the first part of the domain. For example, `foo.bar.baz` is converted to `foo`.
  The port part is left in the output string. E.g. `foo.bar:1234` is converted into `foo:1234`.
- `stripPort` - strips `port` part from `host:port` input string.
- `strvalue` - returns the metric name from the input query result.
- `title` - converts the first letters of every input word to uppercase.
- `toLower` - converts all the chars in the input string to lowercase.
- `toTime` - converts the input unix timestamp to [time.Time](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time).
- `toUpper` - converts all the chars in the input string to uppercase.
- `value` - returns the numeric value from the input query result.

#### Reusable templates

Like in Alertmanager you can define [reusable templates](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/template_examples/#defining-reusable-templates)
to share same templates across annotations. Just define the templates in a file and
set the path via `-rule.templates` flag.

For example, template `grafana.filter` can be defined as following:

{% raw  %}
```
{{ define "grafana.filter" -}}
  {{- $labels := .arg0 -}}
  {{- range $name, $label := . -}}
    {{- if (ne $name "arg0") -}}
      {{- ( or (index $labels $label) "All" ) | printf "&var-%s=%s" $label -}}
    {{- end -}}
  {{- end -}}
{{- end -}}
```
{% endraw %}

And then used in annotations:

{% raw  %}
```yaml
groups:
  - name: AlertGroupName
    rules:
      - alert: AlertName
        expr: any_metric > 100
        for: 30s
        labels:
          alertname: 'Any metric is too high'
          severity: 'warning'
        annotations:
          dashboard: '{{ $externalURL }}/d/dashboard?orgId=1{{ template "grafana.filter" (args .CommonLabels "account_id" "any_label") }}'
```
{% endraw %}

The `-rule.templates` flag supports wildcards so multiple files with templates can be loaded.
The content of `-rule.templates` can be also [hot reloaded](#hot-config-reload).


#### Recording rules

The syntax for recording rules is following:

```yaml
# The name of the time series to output to. Must be a valid metric name.
record: <string>

# The expression to evaluate. The expression language depends on the type value.
# By default, MetricsQL expression is used. If group.type="graphite", then the expression
# must contain valid Graphite expression.
expr: <string>

# Labels to add or overwrite before storing the result.
labels:
  [ <labelname>: <labelvalue> ]


# Defines the number of rule's updates entries stored in memory
# and available for view on rule's Details page.
# Overrides `rule.updateEntriesLimit` value for this specific rule.
[ update_entries_limit: <integer> | default 0 ]
```

For recording rules to work `-remoteWrite.url` must be specified.

### Alerts state on restarts

`vmalert` holds alerts state in the memory. Restart of the `vmalert` process will reset the state of all active alerts 
in the memory. To prevent `vmalert` from losing the state on restarts configure it to persist the state 
to the remote database via the following flags:

* `-remoteWrite.url` - URL to VictoriaMetrics (Single) or vminsert (Cluster). `vmalert` will persist alerts state
  to the configured address in the form of [time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#time-series)
  `ALERTS` and `ALERTS_FOR_STATE` via remote-write protocol.
  These time series can be queried from VictoriaMetrics just as any other time series.
  The state will be persisted to the configured address on each evaluation.
* `-remoteRead.url` - URL to VictoriaMetrics (Single) or vmselect (Cluster). `vmalert` will try to restore alerts state
  from the configured address by querying time series with name `ALERTS_FOR_STATE`. The restore happens only once when
  `vmalert` process starts, and only for the configured rules. Config [hot reload](#hot-config-reload) doesn't trigger 
  state restore.

Both flags are required for proper state restoration. Restore process may fail if time series are missing
in configured `-remoteRead.url`, weren't updated in the last `1h` (controlled by `-remoteRead.lookback`)
or received state doesn't match current `vmalert` rules configuration. `vmalert` marks successfully restored rules
with `restored` label in [web UI](#web).

### Multitenancy

There are the following approaches exist for alerting and recording rules across
[multiple tenants](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#multitenancy):

* To run a separate `vmalert` instance per each tenant.
  The corresponding tenant must be specified in `-datasource.url` command-line flag
  according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#url-format).
  For example, `/path/to/vmalert -datasource.url=http://vmselect:8481/select/123/prometheus`
  would run alerts against `AccountID=123`. For recording rules the `-remoteWrite.url` command-line
  flag must contain the url for the specific tenant as well.
  For example, `-remoteWrite.url=http://vminsert:8480/insert/123/prometheus` would write recording
  rules to `AccountID=123`.

* To specify `tenant` parameter per each alerting and recording group if
  [enterprise version of vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html) is used
  with `-clusterMode` command-line flag. For example:

```yaml
groups:
- name: rules_for_tenant_123
  tenant: "123"
  rules:
    # Rules for accountID=123

- name: rules_for_tenant_456:789
  tenant: "456:789"
  rules:
    # Rules for accountID=456, projectID=789
```

The results of alerting and recording rules contain `vm_account_id` and `vm_project_id` labels
if `-clusterMode` is enabled. These labels can be used during [templating](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#templating),
and help to identify to which account or project the triggered alert or produced recording belongs.

If `-clusterMode` is enabled, then `-datasource.url`, `-remoteRead.url` and `-remoteWrite.url` must
contain only the hostname without tenant id. For example: `-datasource.url=http://vmselect:8481`.
`vmalert` automatically adds the specified tenant to urls per each recording rule in this case.

If `-clusterMode` is enabled and the `tenant` in a particular group is missing, then the tenant value
is obtained from `-defaultTenant.prometheus` or `-defaultTenant.graphite` depending on the `type` of the group.

The enterprise version of vmalert is available in `vmutils-*-enterprise.tar.gz` files
at [release page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/latest) and in `*-enterprise`
tags at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/vmalert/tags).

### Reading rules from object storage

[Enterprise version](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html) of `vmalert` may read alerting and recording rules
from object storage:

- `./bin/vmalert -rule=s3://bucket/dir/alert.rules` would read rules from the given path at S3 bucket
- `./bin/vmalert -rule=gs://bucket/bir/alert.rules` would read rules from the given path at GCS bucket

S3 and GCS paths support only matching by prefix, e.g. `s3://bucket/dir/rule_` matches
all files with prefix `rule_` in the folder `dir`.

The following [command-line flags](#flags) can be used for fine-tuning access to S3 and GCS:

- `-s3.credsFilePath` - path to file with GCS or S3 credentials. Credentials are loaded from default locations if not set.
- `-s3.configFilePath` - path to file with S3 configs. Configs are loaded from default location if not set.
- `-s3.configProfile` - profile name for S3 configs. If no set, the value of the environment variable will be loaded (`AWS_PROFILE` or `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE`).
- `-s3.customEndpoint` - custom S3 endpoint for use with S3-compatible storages (e.g. MinIO). S3 is used if not set.
- `-s3.forcePathStyle` - prefixing endpoint with bucket name when set false, true by default.

### Topology examples

The following sections are showing how `vmalert` may be used and configured
for different scenarios.

Please note, not all flags in examples are required:

* `-remoteWrite.url` and `-remoteRead.url` are optional and are needed only if
  you have recording rules or want to store [alerts state](#alerts-state-on-restarts) on `vmalert` restarts;
* `-notifier.url` is optional and is needed only if you have alerting rules.

#### Single-node VictoriaMetrics

The simplest configuration where one single-node VM server is used for
rules execution, storing recording rules results and alerts state.

`vmalert` configuration flags:

```
./bin/vmalert -rule=rules.yml  \                    # Path to the file with rules configuration. Supports wildcard
    -datasource.url=http://victoriametrics:8428 \   # VM-single addr for executing rules expressions
    -remoteWrite.url=http://victoriametrics:8428 \  # VM-single addr to persist alerts state and recording rules results
    -remoteRead.url=http://victoriametrics:8428 \   # VM-single addr for restoring alerts state after restart
    -notifier.url=http://alertmanager:9093          # AlertManager addr to send alerts when they trigger
```

<img alt="vmalert single" width="500" src="vmalert_single.webp">

#### Cluster VictoriaMetrics

In [cluster mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html)
VictoriaMetrics has separate components for writing and reading path:
`vminsert` and `vmselect` components respectively. `vmselect` is used for executing rules expressions
and `vminsert` is used to persist recording rules results and alerts state.
Cluster mode could have multiple `vminsert` and `vmselect` components.

`vmalert` configuration flags:

```
./bin/vmalert -rule=rules.yml  \                                # Path to the file with rules configuration. Supports wildcard
    -datasource.url=http://vmselect:8481/select/0/prometheus    # vmselect addr for executing rules expressions
    -remoteWrite.url=http://vminsert:8480/insert/0/prometheus   # vminsert addr to persist alerts state and recording rules results
    -remoteRead.url=http://vmselect:8481/select/0/prometheus    # vmselect addr for restoring alerts state after restart
    -notifier.url=http://alertmanager:9093                      # AlertManager addr to send alerts when they trigger
```

<img alt="vmalert cluster" src="vmalert_cluster.webp">

In case when you want to spread the load on these components - add balancers before them and configure
`vmalert` with balancer addresses. Please, see more about VM's cluster architecture
[here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#architecture-overview).

#### HA vmalert

For High Availability(HA) user can run multiple identically configured `vmalert` instances.
It means all of them will execute the same rules, write state and results to
the same destinations, and send alert notifications to multiple configured
Alertmanagers.

`vmalert` configuration flags:

```
./bin/vmalert -rule=rules.yml \                   # Path to the file with rules configuration. Supports wildcard
    -datasource.url=http://victoriametrics:8428 \   # VM-single addr for executing rules expressions
    -remoteWrite.url=http://victoriametrics:8428 \  # VM-single addr to persist alerts state and recording rules results
    -remoteRead.url=http://victoriametrics:8428 \   # VM-single addr for restoring alerts state after restart
    -notifier.url=http://alertmanager1:9093 \       # Multiple AlertManager addresses to send alerts when they trigger
    -notifier.url=http://alertmanagerN:9093         # The same alert will be sent to all configured notifiers
```

<img alt="vmalert ha" width="800px" src="vmalert_ha.webp">

To avoid recording rules results and alerts state duplication in VictoriaMetrics server
don't forget to configure [deduplication](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#deduplication).
Multiple equally configured vmalerts should evaluate rules at the same timestamps, so it is recommended 
to set `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` as equal to vmalert's `-evaluationInterval`.

If you have multiple different `interval` params for distinct rule groups, then set `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` to
the biggest `interval` value, or value which will be a multiple for all `interval` values. For example, if you have
two groups with `interval: 10s` and `interval: 15s`, then set `-dedup.minScrapeInterval=30s`. This would consistently
keep only a single data point on 30s time interval for all rules. However, try to avoid having inconsistent `interval`
values.

It is not recommended having `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` smaller than `-evaluationInterval`, as it may produce 
results with inconsistent intervals between data points.

Alertmanager will automatically deduplicate alerts with identical labels, so ensure that
all `vmalert`s are having identical config.

Don't forget to configure [cluster mode](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/)
for Alertmanagers for better reliability. List all Alertmanager URLs in vmalert `-notifier.url`
to ensure [high availability](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager#high-availability).

This example uses single-node VM server for the sake of simplicity.
Check how to replace it with [cluster VictoriaMetrics](#cluster-victoriametrics) if needed.

#### Downsampling and aggregation via vmalert

_Please note, [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation.html) might be more efficient
for cases when downsampling or aggregation need to be applied **before data gets into the TSDB.**_

`vmalert` can't modify existing data. But it can run arbitrary PromQL/MetricsQL queries
via [recording rules](#recording-rules) and backfill results to the configured `-remoteWrite.url`.
This ability allows to aggregate data. For example, the following rule will calculate the average value for
metric `http_requests` on the `5m` interval:

```yaml
  - record: http_requests:avg5m
    expr: avg_over_time(http_requests[5m])
```

Every time this rule will be evaluated, `vmalert` will backfill its results as a new time series `http_requests:avg5m`
to the configured `-remoteWrite.url`.

`vmalert` executes rules with specified interval (configured via flag `-evaluationInterval`
or as [group's](#groups) `interval` param). The interval helps to control "resolution" of the produced series.
This ability allows to downsample data. For example, the following config will execute the rule only once every `5m`:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: my_group
    interval: 5m
    rules:
    - record: http_requests:avg5m
      expr: avg_over_time(http_requests[5m])
```

Ability of `vmalert` to be configured with different `-datasource.url` and `-remoteWrite.url` command-line flags
allows reading data from one data source and backfilling results to another. This helps to build a system
for aggregating and downsampling the data.

The following example shows how to build a topology where `vmalert` will process data from one cluster
and write results into another. Such clusters may be called as "hot" (low retention,
high-speed disks, used for operative monitoring) and "cold" (long term retention,
slower/cheaper disks, low resolution data). With help of `vmalert`, user can setup
recording rules to process raw data from "hot" cluster (by applying additional transformations
or reducing resolution) and push results to "cold" cluster.

`vmalert` configuration flags:

```
./bin/vmalert -rule=downsampling-rules.yml \                                        # Path to the file with rules configuration. Supports wildcard
    -datasource.url=http://raw-cluster-vmselect:8481/select/0/prometheus            # vmselect addr for executing recording rules expressions
    -remoteWrite.url=http://aggregated-cluster-vminsert:8480/insert/0/prometheus    # vminsert addr to persist recording rules results
```

<img alt="vmalert multi cluster" src="vmalert_multicluster.webp">

Please note, [replay](#rules-backfilling) feature may be used for transforming historical data.

Flags `-remoteRead.url` and `-notifier.url` are omitted since we assume only recording rules are used.

See also [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation.html) and [downsampling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling).

#### Multiple remote writes

For persisting recording or alerting rule results `vmalert` requires `-remoteWrite.url` to be set.
But this flag supports only one destination. To persist rule results to multiple destinations
we recommend using [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html) as fan-out proxy:

<img alt="vmalert multiple remote write destinations" src="vmalert_multiple_rw.webp">

In this topology, `vmalert` is configured to persist rule results to `vmagent`. And `vmagent`
is configured to fan-out received data to two or more destinations.
Using `vmagent` as a proxy provides additional benefits such as
[data persisting when storage is unreachable](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#replication-and-high-availability),
or time series modification via [relabeling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#relabeling).


### Web

`vmalert` runs a web-server (`-httpListenAddr`) for serving metrics and alerts endpoints:

* `http://<vmalert-addr>` - UI;
* `http://<vmalert-addr>/api/v1/rules` - list of all loaded groups and rules;
* `http://<vmalert-addr>/api/v1/alerts` - list of all active alerts;
* `http://<vmalert-addr>/vmalert/api/v1/alert?group_id=<group_id>&alert_id=<alert_id>` - get alert status in JSON format.
  Used as alert source in AlertManager.
* `http://<vmalert-addr>/vmalert/alert?group_id=<group_id>&alert_id=<alert_id>` - get alert status in web UI.
* `http://<vmalert-addr>/vmalert/rule?group_id=<group_id>&rule_id=<rule_id>` - get rule status in web UI.
* `http://<vmalert-addr>/vmalert/api/v1/rule?group_id=<group_id>&alert_id=<alert_id>` - get rule status in JSON format.
* `http://<vmalert-addr>/metrics` - application metrics.
* `http://<vmalert-addr>/-/reload` - hot configuration reload.

`vmalert` web UI can be accessed from [single-node version of VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html)
and from [cluster version of VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html).
This may be used for better integration with Grafana unified alerting system. See the following docs for details:

* [How to query vmalert from single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#vmalert)
* [How to query vmalert from VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#vmalert)


## Graphite

vmalert sends requests to `<-datasource.url>/render?format=json` during evaluation of alerting and recording rules
if the corresponding group or rule contains `type: "graphite"` config option. It is expected that the `<-datasource.url>/render`
implements [Graphite Render API](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/render_api.html) for `format=json`.
When using vmalert with both `graphite` and `prometheus` rules configured against cluster version of VM do not forget
to set `-datasource.appendTypePrefix` flag to `true`, so vmalert can adjust URL prefix automatically based on the query type.

## Rules backfilling

vmalert supports alerting and recording rules backfilling (aka `replay`). In replay mode vmalert
can read the same rules configuration as normal, evaluate them on the given time range and backfill
results via remote write to the configured storage. vmalert supports any PromQL/MetricsQL compatible
data source for backfilling.

Please note, that response caching may lead to unexpected results during and after backfilling process.
In order to avoid this you need to reset cache contents or disable caching when using backfilling
as described in [backfilling docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#backfilling).

See a blogpost about [Rules backfilling via vmalert](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/rules-replay/).

### How it works

In `replay` mode vmalert works as a cli-tool and exits immediately after work is done.
To run vmalert in `replay` mode:

```
./bin/vmalert -rule=path/to/your.rules \        # path to files with rules you usually use with vmalert
    -datasource.url=http://localhost:8428 \     # Prometheus HTTP API compatible datasource
    -remoteWrite.url=http://localhost:8428 \    # remote write compatible storage to persist results
    -replay.timeFrom=2021-05-11T07:21:43Z \     # time from begin replay
    -replay.timeTo=2021-05-29T18:40:43Z         # time to finish replay
```

The output of the command will look like the following:

```
Replay mode:
from:   2021-05-11 07:21:43 +0000 UTC   # set by -replay.timeFrom
to:     2021-05-29 18:40:43 +0000 UTC   # set by -replay.timeTo
max data points per request: 1000       # set by -replay.maxDatapointsPerQuery

```

In `replay` mode all groups are executed sequentially one-by-one. Rules within the group are
executed sequentially as well (`concurrency` setting is ignored). Vmalert sends rule's expression
to [/query_range](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#range-query) endpoint
of the configured `-datasource.url`. Returned data is then processed according to the rule type and
backfilled to `-remoteWrite.url` via [remote Write protocol](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#remote-storage-integrations).
Vmalert respects `evaluationInterval` value set by flag or per-group during the replay.
Vmalert automatically disables caching on VictoriaMetrics side by sending `nocache=1` param. It allows
to prevent cache pollution and unwanted time range boundaries adjustment during backfilling.

#### Recording rules

The result of recording rules `replay` should match with results of normal rules evaluation.

#### Alerting rules

The result of alerting rules `replay` is time series reflecting [alert's state](#alerts-state-on-restarts).
To see if `replayed` alert has fired in the past use the following PromQL/MetricsQL expression:

```
ALERTS{alertname="your_alertname", alertstate="firing"}
```

Execute the query against storage which was used for `-remoteWrite.url` during the `replay`.

### Additional configuration

There are following non-required `replay` flags:

* `-replay.maxDatapointsPerQuery` - the max number of data points expected to receive in one request.
  In two words, it affects the max time range for every `/query_range` request. The higher the value,
  the fewer requests will be issued during `replay`.
* `-replay.ruleRetryAttempts` - when datasource fails to respond vmalert will make this number of retries
  per rule before giving up.
* `-replay.rulesDelay` - delay between sequential rules execution. Important in cases if there are chaining
  (rules which depend on each other) rules. It is expected, that remote storage will be able to persist
  previously accepted data during the delay, so data will be available for the subsequent queries.
  Keep it equal or bigger than `-remoteWrite.flushInterval`.
* `-replay.disableProgressBar` - whether to disable progress bar which shows progress work.
  Progress bar may generate a lot of log records, which is not formatted as standard VictoriaMetrics logger.
  It could break logs parsing by external system and generate additional load on it.

See full description for these flags in `./vmalert -help`.

### Limitations

* Graphite engine isn't supported yet;
* `query` template function is disabled for performance reasons (might be changed in future);
* `limit` group's param has no effect during replay (might be changed in future);
* `keep_firing_for` alerting rule param has no effect during replay (might be changed in future).

## Unit Testing for Rules

You can use `vmalert-tool` to test your alerting and recording rules like [promtool does](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/unit_testing_rules/).
See more details [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert-tool.html#Unit-testing-for-rules).

## Monitoring

`vmalert` exports various metrics in Prometheus exposition format at `http://vmalert-host:8880/metrics` page.
The default list of alerting rules for these metric can be found [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker).
We recommend setting up regular scraping of this page either through `vmagent` or by Prometheus so that the exported
metrics may be analyzed later.

Use the official [Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14950-victoriametrics-vmalert/) for `vmalert` overview. 
Graphs on this dashboard contain useful hints - hover the `i` icon in the top left corner of each graph in order to read it.
If you have suggestions for improvements or have found a bug - please open an issue on github or add
a review to the dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### Data delay

Data delay is one of the most common issues with rules execution.
vmalert executes configured rules within certain intervals at specifics timestamps. 
It expects that the data is already present in configured `-datasource.url` at the moment of time when rule is executed:

<img alt="vmalert expected evaluation" src="vmalert_ts_normal.gif">

Usually, troubles start to appear when data in `-datasource.url` is delayed or absent. In such cases, evaluations
may get empty response from the datasource and produce empty recording rules or reset alerts state:

<img alt="vmalert evaluation when data is delayed" src="vmalert_ts_data_delay.gif">

Try the following recommendations to reduce the chance of hitting the data delay issue:

* Always configure group's `-evaluationInterval` to be bigger or at least equal to
[time series resolution](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#time-series-resolution);
* Ensure that `[duration]` value is at least twice bigger than 
[time series resolution](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#time-series-resolution). For example,
if expression is `rate(my_metric[2m]) > 0` then ensure that `my_metric` resolution is at least `1m` or better `30s`. 
If you use VictoriaMetrics as datasource, `[duration]` can be omitted and VictoriaMetrics will adjust it automatically.
* Extend `[duration]` in expr to help tolerate the delay. For example, `max_over_time(errors_total[10m]) > 0` will be active even if there is no data in datasource for last `9m`.
* If [time series resolution](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#time-series-resolution)
in datasource is inconsistent or `>=5min` - try changing vmalerts `-datasource.queryStep` command-line flag to specify
how far search query can lookback for the recent datapoint. The recommendation is to have the step 
at least two times bigger than the resolution.

> Please note, data delay is inevitable in distributed systems. And it is better to account for it instead of ignoring.

By default, recently written samples to VictoriaMetrics [aren't visible for queries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#query-latency)
for up to 30s (see `-search.latencyOffset` command-line flag at vmselect or VictoriaMetrics single-node). Such delay is needed to eliminate risk of 
incomplete data on the moment of querying, due to chance that metrics collectors won't be able to deliver that data in time.
To compensate the latency in timestamps for produced evaluation results, `-rule.evalDelay` is also set to `30s` by default.
If you expect data to be delayed for longer intervals (it gets buffered, queued, or just network is slow sometimes)
- consider increasing the `-rule.evalDelay` value accordingly.

### Alerts state

Sometimes, it is not clear why some specific alert fired or didn't fire. It is very important to remember, that
alerts with `for: 0` fire immediately when their expression becomes true. And alerts with `for > 0` will fire only
after multiple consecutive evaluations, and at each evaluation their expression must be true. If at least one evaluation
becomes false, then alert's state resets to the initial state.

If `-remoteWrite.url` command-line flag is configured, vmalert will persist alert's state in form of time series
`ALERTS` and `ALERTS_FOR_STATE` to the specified destination. Such time series can be then queried via
[vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#vmui) or Grafana to track how alerts state
changed in time.

vmalert stores last `-rule.updateEntriesLimit` (or `update_entries_limit` [per-rule config](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#alerting-rules)) 
state updates for each rule starting from [v1.86](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1860).
To check updates, click on `Details` link next to rule's name on `/vmalert/groups` page 
and check the `Last updates` section:

<img alt="vmalert state" src="vmalert_state.webp">

Rows in the section represent ordered rule evaluations and their results. The column `curl` contains an example of
HTTP request sent by vmalert to the `-datasource.url` during evaluation. If specific state shows that there were
no samples returned and curl command returns data - then it is very likely there was no data in datasource on the
moment when rule was evaluated. Sensitive info is stripped from the `curl` examples - see [security](#security) section
for more details.

### Debug mode

vmalert allows configuring more detailed logging for specific alerting rule starting from [v1.82](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1820).
Just set `debug: true` in rule's configuration and vmalert will start printing additional log messages:
```terminal

```

Sensitive info is stripped from the `curl` examples - see [security](#security) section for more details.

### Never-firing alerts

vmalert can detect if alert's expression doesn't match any time series in runtime 
starting from [v1.91](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1910). This problem usually happens
when alerting expression selects time series which aren't present in the datasource (i.e. wrong `job` label)
or there is a typo in the series selector (i.e. `env=rpod`). Such alerting rules will be marked with special icon in 
vmalerts UI and exposed via `vmalert_alerting_rules_last_evaluation_series_fetched` metric. The metric value will
show how many time series were matched before the filtering by rule's expression. If metric value is `-1`, then
this feature is not supported by the datasource (old versions of VictoriaMetrics). The following expression can be
used to detect rules matching no series:
```
max(vmalert_alerting_rules_last_evaluation_series_fetched) by(group, alertname) == 0
```

See more details [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4039).
This feature is available only if vmalert is using VictoriaMetrics v1.90 or higher as a datasource.

## Security

See general recommendations regarding security [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#security).

vmalert [web UI](#web) exposes configuration details such as list of [Groups](#groups), active alerts, 
[alerts state](#alerts-state), [notifiers](#notifier-configuration-file). Notifier addresses (sanitized) are attached
as labels to metrics `vmalert_alerts_sent_.*` on `http://<vmalert>/metrics` page. Consider limiting user's access 
to the web UI or `/metrics` page if this information is sensitive.

[Alerts state](#alerts-state) page or [debug mode](#debug-mode) could emit additional information about configured
datasource URL, GET params and headers. Sensitive information such as passwords or auth tokens is stripped by default.
To disable stripping of such info pass `-datasource.showURL` cmd-line flag to vmalert.


## Profiling

`vmalert` provides handlers for collecting the following [Go profiles](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs):

* Memory profile. It can be collected with the following command (replace `0.0.0.0` with hostname if needed):

<div class="with-copy" markdown="1">

```console
curl http://0.0.0.0:8880/debug/pprof/heap > mem.pprof
```

</div>

* CPU profile. It can be collected with the following command (replace `0.0.0.0` with hostname if needed):

<div class="with-copy" markdown="1">

```console
curl http://0.0.0.0:8880/debug/pprof/profile > cpu.pprof
```

</div>

The command for collecting CPU profile waits for 30 seconds before returning.

The collected profiles may be analyzed with [go tool pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof).
It is safe sharing the collected profiles from security point of view, since they do not contain sensitive information.

## Configuration

### Flags

Pass `-help` to `vmalert` in order to see the full list of supported
command-line flags with their descriptions.

The shortlist of configuration flags is the following:
{% raw  %}
```console
  -clusterMode
     If clusterMode is enabled, then vmalert automatically adds the tenant specified in config groups to -datasource.url, -remoteWrite.url and -remoteRead.url. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#multitenancy . This flag is available only in Enterprise binaries. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html
  -configCheckInterval duration
     Interval for checking for changes in '-rule' or '-notifier.config' files. By default, the checking is disabled. Send SIGHUP signal in order to force config check for changes.

  -datasource.bearerTokenFile string
     Optional path to bearer token file to use for -datasource.url.
  -datasource.disableKeepAlive
     Whether to disable long-lived connections to the datasource. If true, disables HTTP keep-alives and will only use the connection to the server for a single HTTP request.
  -datasource.disableStepParam
     Whether to disable adding 'step' param to the issued instant queries.

It is not recommended to enable this flag if you use vmalert with VictoriaMetrics.
  -datasource.headers string
     Optional HTTP extraHeaders to send with each request to the corresponding -datasource.url. For example, -datasource.headers='My-Auth:foobar' would send 'My-Auth: foobar' HTTP header with every request to the corresponding -datasource.url.

  -datasource.lookback duration
     Will be deprecated soon, please adjust "-search.latencyOffset"  at datasource side or specify "latency_offset" in rule group's params. Lookback defines how far into the past to look when evaluating queries. For example, if the datasource.lookback=5m then param "time" with value now()-5m will be added to every query.
  -datasource.maxIdleConnections int
     Defines the number of idle (keep-alive connections) to each configured datasource. Consider setting this value equal to the value: groups_total * group.concurrency. Too low a value may result in a high number of sockets in TIME_WAIT state. (default 100)

### Hot config reload

`vmalert` supports "hot" config reload via the following methods:

* send SIGHUP signal to `vmalert` process;
* send GET request to `/-/reload` endpoint;
* configure `-configCheckInterval` flag for periodic reload
  on config change.

### URL params

To set additional URL params for `datasource.url`, `remoteWrite.url` or `remoteRead.url`
just add them in address: `-datasource.url=http://localhost:8428?nocache=1`.

To set additional URL params for specific [group of rules](#Groups) modify
the `params` group:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: TestGroup
    params:
      denyPartialResponse: ["true"]
      extra_label: ["env=dev"]
```

Please note, `params` are used only for executing rules expressions (requests to `datasource.url`).
If there would be a conflict between URL params set in `datasource.url` flag and params in group definition
the latter will have higher priority.

### Notifier configuration file

Notifier also supports configuration via file specified with flag `notifier.config`:

```
./bin/vmalert -rule=app/vmalert/config/testdata/rules.good.rules \
  -datasource.url=http://localhost:8428 \
  -notifier.config=app/vmalert/notifier/testdata/consul.good.yaml
```

The configuration file allows to configure static notifiers, discover notifiers via
[Consul](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#consul_sd_config)
and [DNS](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#dns_sd_config):
For example:

```yaml
static_configs:
  - targets:
      # support using full url
      - 'http://alertmanager:9093/test/api/v2/alerts'
      - 'https://alertmanager:9093/api/v2/alerts'
      # the following target with only host:port will be used as <scheme>://localhost:9093/<path_prefix>/api/v2/alerts
      - localhost:9093

consul_sd_configs:
  - server: localhost:8500
    services:
      - alertmanager

dns_sd_configs:
  - names:
      - my.domain.com
    type: 'A'
    port: 9093
```

The list of configured or discovered Notifiers can be explored via [UI](#web).
If Alertmanager runs in cluster mode then all its URLs needs to be available during discovery
to ensure [high availability](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager#high-availability).

The configuration file [specification](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmalert/notifier/config.go)
is the following:

```yaml
# Per-target Notifier timeout when pushing alerts.
[ timeout: <duration> | default = 10s ]

# Prefix for the HTTP path alerts are pushed to.
[ path_prefix: <path> | default = / ]

# Configures the protocol scheme used for requests.
[ scheme: <scheme> | default = http ]

# Sets the `Authorization` header on every request with the
# configured username and password.
# password and password_file are mutually exclusive.
basic_auth:
  [ username: <string> ]

headers:
  [ <string>, ...]
