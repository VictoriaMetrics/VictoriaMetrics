# Cluster version

<img alt="VictoriaMetrics" src="logo.png">

VictoriaMetrics is a fast, cost-effective and scalable time series database. It can be used as a long-term remote storage for Prometheus.

It is recommended to use the [single-node version](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics) instead of the cluster version
for ingestion rates lower than a million data points per second.
The single-node version [scales perfectly](https://medium.com/@valyala/measuring-vertical-scalability-for-time-series-databases-in-google-cloud-92550d78d8ae)
with the number of CPU cores, RAM and available storage space.
The single-node version is easier to configure and operate compared to the cluster version, so think twice before choosing the cluster version.

Join [our Slack](https://slack.victoriametrics.com/) or [contact us](mailto:info@victoriametrics.com) with consulting and support questions.

## Prominent features

- Supports all the features of the [single-node version](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
- Performance and capacity scale horizontally. See [these docs for details](#cluster-resizing-and-scalability).
- Supports multiple independent namespaces for time series data (aka multi-tenancy). See [these docs for details](#multitenancy).
- Supports replication. See [these docs for details](#replication-and-data-safety).

## Architecture overview

VictoriaMetrics cluster consists of the following services:

- `vmstorage` - stores the raw data and returns the queried data on the given time range for the given label filters
- `vminsert` - accepts the ingested data and spreads it among `vmstorage` nodes according to consistent hashing over metric name and all its labels
- `vmselect` - performs incoming queries by fetching the needed data from all the configured `vmstorage` nodes

Each service may scale independently and may run on the most suitable hardware.
`vmstorage` nodes don't know about each other, don't communicate with each other and don't share any data.
This is a [shared nothing architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared-nothing_architecture).
It increases cluster availability, and simplifies cluster maintenance as well as cluster scaling.

## Multitenancy

VictoriaMetrics cluster supports multiple isolated tenants (aka namespaces).
Tenants are identified by `accountID` or `accountID:projectID`, which are put inside request urls.
See [these docs](#url-format) for details. Some facts about tenants in VictoriaMetrics:

- Each `accountID` and `projectID` is identified by an arbitrary 32-bit integer in the range `[0 .. 2^32)`.
If `projectID` is missing, then it is automatically assigned to `0`. It is expected that other information about tenants
such as auth tokens, tenant names, limits, accounting, etc. is stored in a separate relational database. This database must be managed
by a separate service sitting in front of VictoriaMetrics cluster such as [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html) or [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway.html). [Contact us](mailto:info@victoriametrics.com) if you need assistance with such service.

- Tenants are automatically created when the first data point is written into the given tenant.

- Data for all the tenants is evenly spread among available `vmstorage` nodes. This guarantees even load among `vmstorage` nodes
when different tenants have different amounts of data and different query load.

- The database performance and resource usage doesn't depend on the number of tenants. It depends mostly on the total number of active time series in all the tenants. A time series is considered active if it received at least a single sample during the last hour or it has been touched by queries during the last hour.

- VictoriaMetrics doesn't support querying multiple tenants in a single request.

## Binaries

Compiled binaries for the cluster version are available in the `assets` section of the [releases page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases).
Also see archives containing the word `cluster`.

Docker images for the cluster version are available here:

- `vminsert` - <https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/vminsert/tags>
- `vmselect` - <https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/vmselect/tags>
- `vmstorage` - <https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/vmstorage/tags>

## Building from sources

The source code for the cluster version is available in the [cluster branch](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/cluster).

### Production builds

There is no need to install Go on a host system since binaries are built
inside [the official docker container for Go](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang).
This allows reproducible builds.
So [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and run the following command:

```
make vminsert-prod vmselect-prod vmstorage-prod
```

Production binaries are built into statically linked binaries. They are put into the `bin` folder with `-prod` suffixes:

```
$ make vminsert-prod vmselect-prod vmstorage-prod
$ ls -1 bin
vminsert-prod
vmselect-prod
vmstorage-prod
```

### Development Builds

1. [Install go](https://golang.org/doc/install). The minimum supported version is Go 1.17.
2. Run `make` from [the repository root](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics). It should build `vmstorage`, `vmselect`
   and `vminsert` binaries and put them into the `bin` folder.

### Building docker images

Run `make package`. It will build the following docker images locally:

- `victoriametrics/vminsert:<PKG_TAG>`
- `victoriametrics/vmselect:<PKG_TAG>`
- `victoriametrics/vmstorage:<PKG_TAG>`

`<PKG_TAG>` is auto-generated image tag, which depends on source code in [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
The `<PKG_TAG>` may be manually set via `PKG_TAG=foobar make package`.

By default images are built on top of [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) image in order to improve debuggability.
It is possible to build an image on top of any other base image by setting it via `<ROOT_IMAGE>` environment variable.
For example, the following command builds images on top of [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) image:

```console
ROOT_IMAGE=scratch make package
```

## Operation

## Cluster setup

A minimal cluster must contain the following nodes:

- a single `vmstorage` node with `-retentionPeriod` and `-storageDataPath` flags
- a single `vminsert` node with `-storageNode=<vmstorage_host>`
- a single `vmselect` node with `-storageNode=<vmstorage_host>`

It is recommended to run at least two nodes for each service for high availability purposes. In this case the cluster continues working when a single node is temporarily unavailable and the remaining nodes can handle the increased workload. The node may be temporarily unavailable when the underlying hardware breaks, during software upgrades, migration or other maintenance tasks.

It is preferred to run many small `vmstorage` nodes over a few big `vmstorage` nodes, since this reduces the workload increase on the remaining `vmstorage` nodes when some of `vmstorage` nodes become temporarily unavailable.

An http load balancer such as [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html) or `nginx` must be put in front of `vminsert` and `vmselect` nodes. It must contain the following routing configs according to [the url format](#url-format):

- requests starting with `/insert` must be routed to port `8480` on `vminsert` nodes.
- requests starting with `/select` must be routed to port `8481` on `vmselect` nodes.

Ports may be altered by setting `-httpListenAddr` on the corresponding nodes.

It is recommended setting up [monitoring](#monitoring) for the cluster.

The following tools can simplify cluster setup:
- [An example docker-compose config for VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/cluster/deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml)
- [Helm charts for VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts)
- [Kubernetes operator for VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator)

It is possible manualy setting up a toy cluster on a single host. In this case every cluster component - `vminsert`, `vmselect` and `vmstorage` - must have distinct values for `-httpListenAddr` command-line flag. This flag specifies http address for accepting http requests for [monitoring](#monitoring) and [profiling](#profiling). `vmstorage` node must have distinct values for the following additional command-line flags in order to prevent resource usage clash:
- `-storageDataPath` - every `vmstorage` node must have a dedicated data storage.
- `-vminsertAddr` - every `vmstorage` node must listen for a distinct tcp address for accepting data from `vminsert` nodes.
- `-vmselectAddr` - every `vmstorage` node must listen for a distinct tcp address for accepting requests from `vmselect` nodes.

### Environment variables

Each flag values can be set through environment variables by following these rules:

- The `-envflag.enable` flag must be set
- Each `.` in flag names must be substituted by `_` (for example `-insert.maxQueueDuration <duration>` will translate to `insert_maxQueueDuration=<duration>`)
- For repeating flags, an alternative syntax can be used by joining the different values into one using `,` as separator (for example `-storageNode <nodeA> -storageNode <nodeB>` will translate to `storageNode=<nodeA>,<nodeB>`)
- It is possible setting prefix for environment vars with `-envflag.prefix`. For instance, if `-envflag.prefix=VM_`, then env vars must be prepended with `VM_`

## mTLS protection

By default `vminsert` and `vmselect` nodes use unencrypted connections to `vmstorage` nodes, since it is assumed that all the cluster components run in a protected environment. [Enterprise version of VictoriaMetrics](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/) provides optional support for [mTLS connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication#mTLS) between cluster components. Pass `-cluster.tls=true` command-line flag to `vminsert`, `vmselect` and `vmstorage` nodes in order to enable mTLS protection. Additionally, `vminsert`, `vmselect` and `vmstorage` must be configured with mTLS certificates via `-cluster.tlsCertFile`, `-cluster.tlsKeyFile` command-line options. These certificates are mutually verified when `vminsert` and `vmselect` dial `vmstorage`.

The following optional command-line flags related to mTLS are supported:

- `-cluster.tlsInsecureSkipVerify` can be set at `vminsert`, `vmselect` and `vmstorage` in order to disable peer certificate verification. Note that this breaks security.
- `-cluster.tlsCAFile` can be set at `vminsert`, `vmselect` and `vmstorage` for verifying peer certificates issued with custom [certificate authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority). By default system-wide certificate authority is used for peer certificate verification.
- `-cluster.tlsCipherSuites` can be set to the list of supported TLS cipher suites at `vmstorage`. See [the list of supported TLS cipher suites](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/tls#pkg-constants).

See [these docs](https://gist.github.com/f41gh7/76ed8e5fb1ebb9737fe746bae9175ee6) on how to set up mTLS in VictoriaMetrics cluster.

[Enterprise version of VictoriaMetrics](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/) can be downloaded and evaluated for free from [the releases page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases).

## Monitoring

All the cluster components expose various metrics in Prometheus-compatible format at `/metrics` page on the TCP port set in `-httpListenAddr` command-line flag.
By default the following TCP ports are used:

- `vminsert` - 8480
- `vmselect` - 8481
- `vmstorage` - 8482

It is recommended setting up [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html)
or Prometheus to scrape `/metrics` pages from all the cluster components, so they can be monitored and analyzed
with [the official Grafana dashboard for VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176)
or [an alternative dashboard for VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11831). Graphs on these dashboards contain useful hints - hover the `i` icon at the top left corner of each graph in order to read it.

It is recommended setting up alerts in [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html) or in Prometheus from [this config](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/cluster/deployment/docker/alerts.yml).

## Readonly mode

`vmstorage` nodes automatically switch to readonly mode when the directory pointed by `-storageDataPath` contains less than `-storage.minFreeDiskSpaceBytes` of free space. `vminsert` nodes stop sending data to such nodes and start re-routing the data to the remaining `vmstorage` nodes.

## URL format

- URLs for data ingestion: `http://<vminsert>:8480/insert/<accountID>/<suffix>`, where:
  - `<accountID>` is an arbitrary 32-bit integer identifying namespace for data ingestion (aka tenant). It is possible to set it as `accountID:projectID`,

- URL for time series deletion: `http://<vmselect>:8481/delete/<accountID>/prometheus/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series?match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_delete>`.
  Note that the `delete_series` handler should be used only in exceptional cases such as deletion of accidentally ingested incorrect time series. It shouldn't
  be used on a regular basis, since it carries non-zero overhead.

- `vmstorage` nodes provide the following HTTP endpoints on `8482` port:
  - `/internal/force_merge` - initiate [forced compactions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#forced-merge) on the given `vmstorage` node.
  - `/snapshot/create` - create [instant snapshot](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282),
    which can be used for backups in background. Snapshots are created in `<storageDataPath>/snapshots` folder, where `<storageDataPath>` is the corresponding
    command-line flag value.
  - `/snapshot/list` - list available snasphots.
  - `/snapshot/delete?snapshot=<id>` - delete the given snapshot.
  - `/snapshot/delete_all` - delete all the snapshots.

  Snapshots may be created independently on each `vmstorage` node. There is no need in synchronizing snapshots' creation
  across `vmstorage` nodes.

## Cluster resizing and scalability

Cluster performance and capacity can be scaled up in two ways:

- By adding more resources (CPU, RAM, disk IO, disk space, network bandwidth) to existing nodes in the cluster (aka vertical scalability).
- By adding more nodes to the cluster (aka horizontal scalability).

General recommendations for cluster scalability:

- Adding more CPU and RAM to existing `vmselect` nodes improves the performance for heavy queries, which process big number of time series with big number of raw samples.
- Adding more `vmstorage` nodes increases the number of [active time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-an-active-time-series) the cluster can handle. This also increases query performance over time series with [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-high-churn-rate). The cluster stability is also improved with the number of `vmstorage` nodes, since active `vmstorage` nodes need to handle lower additional workload when some of `vmstorage` nodes become unavailable.
- Adding more CPU and RAM to existing `vmstorage` nodes increases the number of [active time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-an-active-time-series) the cluster can handle. It is preferred to add more `vmstorage` nodes over adding more CPU and RAM to existing `vmstorage` nodes, since higher number of `vmstorage` nodes increases cluster stability and improves query performance over time series with [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-high-churn-rate).
- Adding more `vminsert` nodes increases the maximum possible data ingestion speed, since the ingested data may be split among bigger number of `vminsert` nodes.
- Adding more `vmselect` nodes increases the maximum possible queries rate, since the incoming concurrent requests may be split among bigger number of `vmselect` nodes.

Steps to add `vmstorage` node:

1. Start new `vmstorage` node with the same `-retentionPeriod` as existing nodes in the cluster.
2. Gradually restart all the `vmselect` nodes with new `-storageNode` arg containing `<new_vmstorage_host>`.
3. Gradually restart all the `vminsert` nodes with new `-storageNode` arg containing `<new_vmstorage_host>`.

## Updating / reconfiguring cluster nodes

All the node types - `vminsert`, `vmselect` and `vmstorage` - may be updated via graceful shutdown.
Send `SIGINT` signal to the corresponding process, wait until it finishes and then start new version
with new configs.

Cluster should remain in working state if at least a single node of each type remains available during
the update process. See [cluster availability](#cluster-availability) section for details.

See also more advanced [cardinality limiter in vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#cardinality-limiter).

## Cluster availability

- HTTP load balancer must stop routing requests to unavailable `vminsert` and `vmselect` nodes.
- The cluster remains available if at least a single `vmstorage` node exists:

  - `vminsert` re-routes incoming data from unavailable `vmstorage` nodes to healthy `vmstorage` nodes
  - `vmselect` continues serving partial responses if at least a single `vmstorage` node is available. If consistency over availability is preferred, then either pass `-search.denyPartialResponse` command-line flag to `vmselect` or pass `deny_partial_response=1` query arg in requests to `vmselect`.

`vmselect` doesn't serve partial responses for API handlers returning raw datapoints - [`/api/v1/export*` endpoints](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-export-time-series), since users usually expect this data is always complete.

Data replication can be used for increasing storage durability. See [these docs](#replication-and-data-safety) for details.

## Capacity planning

VictoriaMetrics uses lower amounts of CPU, RAM and storage space on production workloads compared to competing solutions (Prometheus, Thanos, Cortex, TimescaleDB, InfluxDB, QuestDB, M3DB) according to [our case studies](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CaseStudies.html).

Each node type - `vminsert`, `vmselect` and `vmstorage` - can run on the most suitable hardware. Cluster capacity scales linearly with the available resources. The needed amounts of CPU and RAM per each node type highly depends on the workload - the number of [active time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-an-active-time-series), [series churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-high-churn-rate), query types, query qps, etc. It is recommended setting up a test VictoriaMetrics cluster for your production workload and iteratively scaling per-node resources and the number of nodes per node type until the cluster becomes stable. It is recommended setting up [monitoring for the cluster](#monitoring). It helps determining bottlenecks in cluster setup. It is also recommended following [the troubleshooting docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#troubleshooting).

The needed storage space for the given retention (the retention is set via `-retentionPeriod` command-line flag at `vmstorage`) can be extrapolated from disk space usage in a test run. For example, if the storage space usage is 10GB after a day-long test run on a production workload, then it will need at least `10GB*100=1TB` of disk space for `-retentionPeriod=100d` (100-days retention period). Storage space usage can be monitored with [the official Grafana dashboard for VictoriaMetrics cluster](#monitoring).

It is recommended leaving the following amounts of spare resources:

- 50% of free RAM across all the node types for reducing the probability of OOM (out of memory) crashes and slowdowns during temporary spikes in workload.
- 50% of spare CPU across all the node types for reducing the probability of slowdowns during temporary spikes in workload.
- At least 20% of free storage space at the directory pointed by `-storageDataPath` command-line flag at `vmstorage` nodes. See also `-storage.minFreeDiskSpaceBytes` command-line flag [description for vmstorage](#list-of-command-line-flags-for-vmstorage).

Some capacity planning tips for VictoriaMetrics cluster:

- The [replication](#replication-and-data-safety) increases the amounts of needed resources for the cluster by up to `N` times where `N` is replication factor. This is because `vminsert` stores `N` copies of every ingested sample on distinct `vmstorage` nodes. These copies are de-duplicated by `vmselect` during querying. The most cost-efficient and performant solution for data durability is to rely on replicated durable persistent disks such as [Google Compute persistent disks](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#pdspecs) instead of using the [replication at VictoriaMetrics level](#replication-and-data-safety).
- It is recommended to run a cluster with big number of small `vmstorage` nodes instead of a cluster with small number of big `vmstorage` nodes. This increases chances that the cluster remains available and stable when some of `vmstorage` nodes are temporarily unavailable during maintenance events such as upgrades, configuration changes or migrations. For example, when a cluster contains 10 `vmstorage` nodes and a single node becomes temporarily unavailable, then the workload on the remaining 9 nodes increases by `1/9=11%`. When a cluster contains 3 `vmstorage` nodes and a single node becomes temporarily unavailable, then the workload on the remaining 2 nodes increases by `1/2=50%`. The remaining `vmstorage` nodes may have no enough free capacity for handling the increased workload. In this case the cluster may become overloaded, which may result to decreased availability and stability.
- Cluster capacity for [active time series](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-an-active-time-series) can be increased by increasing RAM and CPU resources per each `vmstorage` node or by adding new `vmstorage` nodes.
- Query latency can be reduced by increasing CPU resources per each `vmselect` node, since each incoming query is processed by a single `vmselect` node. Performance for heavy queries scales with the number of available CPU cores at `vmselect` node, since `vmselect` processes time series referred by the query on all the available CPU cores.
- If the cluster needs to process incoming queries at a high rate, then its capacity can be increased by adding more `vmselect` nodes, so incoming queries could be spread among bigger number of `vmselect` nodes.
- By default `vminsert` compresses the data it sends to `vmstorage` in order to reduce network bandwidth usage. The compression takes additional CPU resources at `vminsert`. If `vminsert` nodes have limited CPU, then the compression can be disabled by passing `-rpc.disableCompression` command-line flag at `vminsert` nodes.
- By default `vmstorage` compresses the data it sends to `vmselect` during queries in order to reduce network bandwidth usage. The compression takes additional CPU resources at `vmstorage`. If `vmstorage` nodes have limited CPU, then the compression can be disabled by passing `-rpc.disableCompression` command-line flag at `vmstorage` nodes.

## Resource usage limits

By default cluster components of VictoriaMetrics are tuned for an optimal resource usage under typical workloads. Some workloads may need fine-grained resource usage limits. In these cases the following command-line flags may be useful:

- `-memory.allowedPercent` and `-search.allowedBytes` limit the amounts of memory, which may be used for various internal caches at all the cluster components of VictoriaMetrics - `vminsert`, `vmselect` and `vmstorage`. Note that VictoriaMetrics components may use more memory, since these flags don't limit additional memory, which may be needed on a per-query basis.
- `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` at `vmselect` component limits the number of unique time series a single query can find and process. `vmselect` passes the limit to `vmstorage` component, which keeps in memory some metainformation about the time series located by each query and spends some CPU time for processing the found time series. This means that the maximum memory usage and CPU usage a single query can use at `vmstorage` is proportional to `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries`.
- `-search.maxQueryDuration` at `vmselect` limits the duration of a single query. If the query takes longer than the given duration, then it is canceled. This allows saving CPU and RAM at `vmselect` and `vmstorage` when executing unexpected heavy queries.
- `-search.maxConcurrentRequests` at `vmselect` limits the number of concurrent requests a single `vmselect` node can process. Bigger number of concurrent requests usually means bigger memory usage at both `vmselect` and `vmstorage`. For example, if a single query needs 100 MiB of additional memory during its execution, then 100 concurrent queries may need `100 * 100 MiB = 10 GiB` of additional memory. So it is better to limit the number of concurrent queries, while suspending additional incoming queries if the concurrency limit is reached. `vmselect` provides `-search.maxQueueDuration` command-line flag for limiting the max wait time for suspended queries.
- `-search.maxSamplesPerSeries` at `vmselect` limits the number of raw samples the query can process per each time series. `vmselect` sequentially processes raw samples per each found time series during the query. It unpacks raw samples on the selected time range per each time series into memory and then applies the given [rollup function](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#rollup-functions). The `-search.maxSamplesPerSeries` command-line flag allows limiting memory usage at `vmselect` in the case when the query is executed on a time range, which contains hundreds of millions of raw samples per each located time series.
- `-search.maxSamplesPerQuery` at `vmselect` limits the number of raw samples a single query can process. This allows limiting CPU usage at `vmselect` for heavy queries.
- `-search.maxSeries` at `vmselect` limits the number of time series, which may be returned from [/api/v1/series](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#finding-series-by-label-matchers). This endpoint is used mostly by Grafana for auto-completion of metric names, label names and label values. Queries to this endpoint may take big amounts of CPU time and memory at `vmstorage` and `vmselect` when the database contains big number of unique time series because of [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-high-churn-rate). In this case it might be useful to set the `-search.maxSeries` to quite low value in order limit CPU and memory usage.
- `-search.maxTagKeys` at `vmselect` limits the number of items, which may be returned from [/api/v1/labels](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#getting-label-names). This endpoint is used mostly by Grafana for auto-completion of label names. Queries to this endpoint may take big amounts of CPU time and memory at `vmstorage` and `vmselect` when the database contains big number of unique time series because of [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-high-churn-rate). In this case it might be useful to set the `-search.maxTagKeys` to quite low value in order to limit CPU and memory usage.
- `-search.maxTagValues` at `vmselect` limits the number of items, which may be returned from [/api/v1/label/.../values](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#querying-label-values). This endpoint is used mostly by Grafana for auto-completion of label values. Queries to this endpoint may take big amounts of CPU time and memory at `vmstorage` and `vmselect` when the database contains big number of unique time series because of [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-high-churn-rate). In this case it might be useful to set the `-search.maxTagValues` to quite low value in order to limit CPU and memory usage.

## High availability

The database is considered highly available if it continues accepting new data and processing incoming queries when some of its components are temporarily unavailable.
VictoriaMetrics cluster is highly available according to this definition - see [cluster availability docs](#cluster-availability).

It is recommended to run all the components for a single cluster in the same subnetwork with high bandwidth, low latency and low error rates.
This improves cluster performance and availability. It isn't recommended spreading components for a single cluster
across multiple availability zones, since cross-AZ network usually has lower bandwidth, higher latency and higher
error rates comparing the network inside a single AZ.

If you need multi-AZ setup, then it is recommended running independed clusters in each AZ and setting up
[vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html) in front of these clusters, so it could replicate incoming data
into all the cluster - see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#multitenancy) for details.
Then [promxy](https://github.com/jacksontj/promxy) could be used for querying the data from multiple clusters.


## Multi-level cluster setup

`vminsert` nodes can accept data from another `vminsert` nodes starting from [v1.60.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1600) if `-clusternativeListenAddr` command-line flag is set. For example, if `vminsert` is started with `-clusternativeListenAddr=:8400` command-line flag, then it can accept data from another `vminsert` nodes at TCP port 8400 in the same way as `vmstorage` nodes do. This allows chaining `vminsert` nodes and building multi-level cluster topologies with flexible configs. For example, the top level of `vminsert` nodes can replicate data among the second level of `vminsert` nodes located in distinct availability zones (AZ), while the second-level `vminsert` nodes can spread the data among `vmstorage` nodes located in the same AZ. Such setup guarantees cluster availability if some AZ becomes unavailable. The data from all the `vmstorage` nodes in all the AZs can be read via `vmselect` nodes, which are configured to query all the `vmstorage` nodes in all the availability zones (e.g. all the `vmstorage` addresses are passed via `-storageNode` command-line flag to `vmselect` nodes).

The multi-level cluster setup for `vminsert` nodes has the following shortcomings because of synchronous replication and data sharding:

* Data ingestion speed is limited by the slowest link to AZ.
* `vminsert` nodes at top level re-route incoming data to the remaining AZs when some AZs are temporariliy unavailable. This results in data gaps at AZs which were temporarily unavailable.

These issues are addressed by [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html) when it runs in [multitenancy mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#multitenancy). `vmagent` buffers data, which must be sent to a particular AZ, when this AZ is temporarily unavailable. The buffer is stored on disk. The buffered data is sent to AZ as soon as it becomes available.

## Helm

It is available in the [helm-charts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts) repository.

## Kubernetes operator

[K8s operator](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator) simplifies managing VictoriaMetrics components in Kubernetes.

## Replication and data safety

By default VictoriaMetrics offloads replication to the underlying storage pointed by `-storageDataPath` such as [Google compute persistent disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#pdspecs), which guarantees data durability. VictoriaMetrics supports application-level replication if replicated durable persistent disks cannot be used for some reason.

The replication can be enabled by passing `-replicationFactor=N` command-line flag to `vminsert`. This instructs `vminsert` to store `N` copies for every ingested sample on `N` distinct `vmstorage` nodes. This guarantees that all the stored data remains available for querying if up to `N-1` `vmstorage` nodes are unavailable.

The cluster must contain at least `2*N-1` `vmstorage` nodes, where `N` is replication factor, in order to maintain the given replication factor for newly ingested data when `N-1` of storage nodes are unavailable.

When the replication is enabled, `-dedup.minScrapeInterval=1ms` command-line flag must be passed to `vmselect` nodes, so they could de-duplicate replicated samples obtained from distinct `vmstorage` nodes during querying. If duplicate data is pushed to VictoriaMetrics from identically configured [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html) instances or Prometheus instances, then the `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` must be set to bigger values according to [deduplication docs](#deduplication).

Note that [replication doesn't save from disaster](https://medium.com/@valyala/speeding-up-backups-for-big-time-series-databases-533c1a927883), so it is recommended performing regular backups. See [these docs](#backups) for details.

Note that the replication increases resource usage - CPU, RAM, disk space, network bandwidth - by up to `-replicationFactor=N` times, because `vminsert` stores `N` copies of incoming data to distinct `vmstorage` nodes and `vmselect` needs to de-duplicate the replicated data obtained from `vmstorage` nodes during querying. So it is more cost-effective to offload the replication to underlying replicated durable storage pointed by `-storageDataPath` such as [Google Compute Engine persistent disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/#pdspecs), which is protected from data loss and data corruption. It also provide consistently high performance and [may be resized](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk) without downtime. HDD-based persistent disks should be enough for the majority of use cases. It is recommended using durable replicated persistent volumes in Kubernetes.

## Deduplication

Cluster version of VictoriaMetrics supports data deduplication in the same way as single-node version do. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#deduplication) for details. The only difference is that the same `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` command-line flag value must be passed to both `vmselect` and `vmstorage` nodes because of the following aspects:

By default `vminsert` tries to route all the samples for a single time series to a single `vmstorage` node. But samples for a single time series can be spread among multiple `vmstorage` nodes under certain conditions:
* when adding/removing `vmstorage` nodes. Then new samples for a part of time series will be routed to another `vmstorage` nodes;
* when `vmstorage` nodes are temporarily unavailable (for instance, during their restart). Then new samples are re-routed to the remaining available `vmstorage` nodes;
* when `vmstorage` node has no enough capacity for processing incoming data stream. Then `vminsert` re-routes new samples to other `vmstorage` nodes.


## Backups

It is recommended performing periodical backups from [instant snapshots](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282)
for protecting from user errors such as accidental data deletion.

The following steps must be performed for each `vmstorage` node for creating a backup:

1. Create an instant snapshot by navigating to `/snapshot/create` HTTP handler. It will create snapshot and return its name.
2. Archive the created snapshot from `<-storageDataPath>/snapshots/<snapshot_name>` folder using [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup.html).
   The archival process doesn't interfere with `vmstorage` work, so it may be performed at any suitable time.
3. Delete unused snapshots via `/snapshot/delete?snapshot=<snapshot_name>` or `/snapshot/delete_all` in order to free up occupied storage space.

There is no need in synchronizing backups among all the `vmstorage` nodes.

Restoring from backup:

1. Stop `vmstorage` node with `kill -INT`.
2. Restore data from backup using [vmrestore](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmrestore.html) into `-storageDataPath` directory.
3. Start `vmstorage` node.

## Downsampling

Downsampling is available in [enterprise version of VictoriaMetrics](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/). It is configured with `-downsampling.period` command-line flag. The same flag value must be passed to both `vmstorage` and `vmselect` nodes. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling) for details.

Enterprise binaries can be downloaded and evaluated for free from [the releases page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases).

## Profiling

All the cluster components provide the following handlers for [profiling](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs):

- `http://vminsert:8480/debug/pprof/heap` for memory profile and `http://vminsert:8480/debug/pprof/profile` for CPU profile
- `http://vmselect:8481/debug/pprof/heap` for memory profile and `http://vmselect:8481/debug/pprof/profile` for CPU profile
- `http://vmstorage:8482/debug/pprof/heap` for memory profile and `http://vmstorage:8482/debug/pprof/profile` for CPU profile

Example command for collecting cpu profile from `vmstorage` (replace `0.0.0.0` with `vmstorage` hostname if needed):

<div class="with-copy" markdown="1">

```console
curl http://0.0.0.0:8482/debug/pprof/profile > cpu.pprof
```

</div>

Example command for collecting memory profile from `vminsert` (replace `0.0.0.0` with `vminsert` hostname if needed):

<div class="with-copy" markdown="1">

```console
curl http://0.0.0.0:8480/debug/pprof/heap > mem.pprof
```

</div>

We are open to third-party pull requests provided they follow the [KISS design principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle):

- Prefer simple code and architecture.
- Avoid complex abstractions.
- Avoid magic code and fancy algorithms.
- Avoid [big external dependencies](https://medium.com/@valyala/stripping-dependency-bloat-in-victoriametrics-docker-image-983fb5912b0d).
- Minimize the number of moving parts in the distributed system.
- Avoid automated decisions, which may hurt cluster availability, consistency or performance.

Adhering to the `KISS` principle simplifies the resulting code and architecture, so it can be reviewed, understood and verified by many people.

Due to `KISS`, cluster version of VictoriaMetrics has no the following "features" popular in distributed computing world:

- Fragile gossip protocols. See [failed attempt in Thanos](https://github.com/improbable-eng/thanos/blob/030bc345c12c446962225221795f4973848caab5/docs/proposals/completed/201809_gossip-removal.md).
- Hard-to-understand-and-implement-properly [Paxos protocols](https://www.quora.com/In-distributed-systems-what-is-a-simple-explanation-of-the-Paxos-algorithm).
- Complex replication schemes, which may go nuts in unforeseen edge cases. See [replication docs](#replication-and-data-safety) for details.
- Automatic data reshuffling between storage nodes, which may hurt cluster performance and availability.
- Automatic cluster resizing, which may cost you a lot of money if improperly configured.
- Automatic discovering and addition of new nodes in the cluster, which may mix data between dev and prod clusters :)
- Automatic leader election, which may result in split brain disaster on network errors.

     The maximum size in bytes of a single DataDog POST request to /api/v1/series
     Supports the following optional suffixes for size values: KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB (default 67108864)
  -denyQueryTracing
     Whether to disable the ability to trace queries. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#query-tracing
  -disableRerouting
     Whether to disable re-routing when some of vmstorage nodes accept incoming data at slower speed compared to other storage nodes. Disabled re-routing limits the ingestion rate by the slowest vmstorage node. On the other side, disabled re-routing minimizes the number of active time series in the cluster during rolling restarts and during spikes in series churn rate. See also -dropSamplesOnOverload (default true)
  -dropSamplesOnOverload
     Whether to drop incoming samples if the destination vmstorage node is overloaded and/or unavailable. This prioritizes cluster availability over consistency, e.g. the cluster continues accepting all the ingested samples, but some of them may be dropped if vmstorage nodes are temporarily unavailable and/or overloaded
  -enableTCP6
     Whether to enable IPv6 for listening and dialing. By default only IPv4 TCP and UDP is used
  -envflag.enable
     Whether to enable reading flags from environment variables additionally to command line. Command line flag values have priority over values from environment vars.

     The maximum duration for a graceful shutdown of the HTTP server. A highly loaded server may require increased value for a graceful shutdown (default 7s)
  -http.pathPrefix string
     An optional prefix to add to all the paths handled by http server. For example, if '-http.pathPrefix=/foo/bar' is set, then all the http requests will be handled on '/foo/bar/*' paths. This may be useful for proxied requests. See https://www.robustperception.io/using-external-urls-and-proxies-with-prometheus
  -http.shutdownDelay duration
     Optional delay before http server shutdown. During this delay, the server returns non-OK responses from /health page, so load balancers can route new requests to other servers
  -httpAuth.password string
     Password for HTTP Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if -httpAuth.username is empty
  -httpAuth.username string
     Username for HTTP Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if empty. See also -httpAuth.password
  -httpListenAddr string
     Address to listen for http connections (default ":8480")

  -influxListenAddr string
     TCP and UDP address to listen for InfluxDB line protocol data. Usually :8089 must be set. Doesn't work if empty. This flag isn't needed when ingesting data over HTTP - just send it to http://<victoriametrics>:8428/write
  -influxMeasurementFieldSeparator string
     Separator for '{measurement}{separator}{field_name}' metric name when inserted via InfluxDB line protocol (default "_")
  -influxSkipMeasurement
     Uses '{field_name}' as a metric name while ignoring '{measurement}' and '-influxMeasurementFieldSeparator'
  -influxSkipSingleField
     Uses '{measurement}' instead of '{measurement}{separator}{field_name}' for metic name if InfluxDB line contains only a single field

  -maxInsertRequestSize size
     The maximum size in bytes of a single Prometheus remote_write API request
     Supports the following optional suffixes for size values: KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB (default 33554432)
  -maxLabelValueLen int
     The maximum length of label values in the accepted time series. Longer label values are truncated. In this case the vm_too_long_label_values_total metric at /metrics page is incremented (default 16384)
  -maxLabelsPerTimeseries int
     The maximum number of labels accepted per time series. Superfluous labels are dropped. In this case the vm_metrics_with_dropped_labels_total metric at /metrics page is incremented (default 30)
  -memory.allowedBytes size
     Allowed size of system memory VictoriaMetrics caches may occupy. This option overrides -memory.allowedPercent if set to a non-zero value. Too low a value may increase the cache miss rate usually resulting in higher CPU and disk IO usage. Too high a value may evict too much data from OS page cache resulting in higher disk IO usage
     Supports the following optional suffixes for size values: KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB (default 0)
  -memory.allowedPercent float
     Allowed percent of system memory VictoriaMetrics caches may occupy. See also -memory.allowedBytes. Too low a value may increase cache miss rate usually resulting in higher CPU and disk IO usage. Too high a value may evict too much data from OS page cache which will result in higher disk IO usage (default 60)
  -metricsAuthKey string
     Auth key for /metrics. It must be passed via authKey query arg. It overrides httpAuth.* settings
  -opentsdbHTTPListenAddr string
     TCP address to listen for OpentTSDB HTTP put requests. Usually :4242 must be set. Doesn't work if empty

  -opentsdbTrimTimestamp duration
     Trim timestamps for OpenTSDB 'telnet put' data to this duration. Minimum practical duration is 1s. Higher duration (i.e. 1m) may be used for reducing disk space usage for timestamp data (default 1s)
  -opentsdbhttp.maxInsertRequestSize size
     The maximum size of OpenTSDB HTTP put request
     Supports the following optional suffixes for size values: KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB (default 33554432)
  -opentsdbhttpTrimTimestamp duration
     Trim timestamps for OpenTSDB HTTP data to this duration. Minimum practical duration is 1ms. Higher duration (i.e. 1s) may be used for reducing disk space usage for timestamp data (default 1ms)
  -pprofAuthKey string
     Auth key for /debug/pprof. It must be passed via authKey query arg. It overrides httpAuth.* settings
  -relabelConfig string

  -relabelDebug
     Whether to log metrics before and after relabeling with -relabelConfig. If the -relabelDebug is enabled, then the metrics aren't sent to storage. This is useful for debugging the relabeling configs
  -replicationFactor int
     Replication factor for the ingested data, i.e. how many copies to make among distinct -storageNode instances. Note that vmselect must run with -dedup.minScrapeInterval=1ms for data de-duplication when replicationFactor is greater than 1. Higher values for -dedup.minScrapeInterval at vmselect is OK (default 1)
  -rpc.disableCompression
     Whether to disable compression for the data sent from vminsert to vmstorage. This reduces CPU usage at the cost of higher network bandwidth usage
  -sortLabels
     Whether to sort labels for incoming samples before writing them to storage. This may be needed for reducing memory usage at storage when the order of labels in incoming samples is random. For example, if m{k1="v1",k2="v2"} may be sent as m{k2="v2",k1="v1"}. Enabled sorting for labels can slow down ingestion performance a bit
  -storageNode array
     Comma-separated addresses of vmstorage nodes; usage: -storageNode=vmstorage-host1,...,vmstorage-hostN
