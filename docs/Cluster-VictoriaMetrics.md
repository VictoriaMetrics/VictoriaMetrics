# Cluster version

<img alt="VictoriaMetrics" src="logo.png">

VictoriaMetrics is a fast, cost-effective and scalable time series database. It can be used as a long-term remote storage for Prometheus.

It is recommended using [single-node version](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics) instead of cluster version
for ingestion rates lower than a million of data points per second.
Single-node version [scales perfectly](https://medium.com/@valyala/measuring-vertical-scalability-for-time-series-databases-in-google-cloud-92550d78d8ae)
with the number of CPU cores, RAM and available storage space.
Single-node version is easier to configure and operate comparing to cluster version, so think twice before sticking to cluster version.

## Prominent features

- Supports all the features of [single-node version](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
- Performance and capacity scales horizontally. See [these docs for details](#cluster-resizing-and-scalability).
- Supports multiple independent namespaces for time series data (aka multi-tenancy). See [these docs for details](#multitenancy).
- Supports replication. See [these docs for details](#replication-and-data-safety).


## Architecture overview

VictoriaMetrics cluster consists of the following services:

- `vmstorage` - stores the raw data and returns the queried data on the given time range for the given label filters
- `vminsert` - accepts the ingested data and spreads it among `vmstorage` nodes according to consistent hashing over metric name and all its labels
- `vmselect` - performs incoming queries by fetching the needed data from all the configured `vmstorage` nodes

Each service may scale independently and may run on the most suitable hardware.
`vmstorage` nodes don't know about each other, don't communicate with each other and don't share any data.
This is [shared nothing architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared-nothing_architecture).
It increases cluster availability, simplifies cluster maintenance and cluster scaling.

## Multitenancy

VictoriaMetrics cluster supports multiple isolated tenants (aka namespaces).
Tenants are identified by `accountID` or `accountID:projectID`, which are put inside request urls.
See [these docs](#url-format) for details. Some facts about tenants in VictoriaMetrics:

* Each `accountID` and `projectID` is identified by an arbitrary 32-bit integer in the range `[0 .. 2^32)`.
If `projectID` is missing, then it is automatically assigned to `0`. It is expected that other information about tenants
such as auth tokens, tenant names, limits, accounting, etc. is stored in a separate relational database. This database must be managed
by a separate service sitting in front of VictoriaMetrics cluster such as [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html) or [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway.html). [Contact us](mailto:info@victoriametrics.com) if you need assistance with such service.

* Tenants are automatically created when the first data point is written into the given tenant.

* Data for all the tenants is evenly spread among available `vmstorage` nodes. This guarantees even load among `vmstorage` nodes
when different tenants have different amounts of data and different query load.

* The database performance and resource usage doesn't depend on the number of tenants. It depends mostly on the total number of active time series in all the tenants. A time series is considered active if it received at least a single sample during the last hour or it has been touched by queries during the last hour.

* VictoriaMetrics doesn't support querying multiple tenants in a single request.


## Binaries

Compiled binaries for cluster version are available in the `assets` section of [releases page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases).
See archives containing `cluster` word.

Docker images for cluster version are available here:

- `vminsert` - https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/vminsert/tags
- `vmselect` - https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/vmselect/tags
- `vmstorage` - https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/vmstorage/tags


## Building from sources

Source code for cluster version is available at [cluster branch](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/cluster).


### Production builds

There is no need in installing Go on a host system since binaries are built
inside [the official docker container for Go](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang).
This makes reproducible builds.
So [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and run the following command:

```
make vminsert-prod vmselect-prod vmstorage-prod
```

Production binaries are built into statically linked binaries. They are put into `bin` folder with `-prod` suffixes:
```
$ make vminsert-prod vmselect-prod vmstorage-prod
$ ls -1 bin
vminsert-prod
vmselect-prod
vmstorage-prod
```

### Development Builds

1. [Install go](https://golang.org/doc/install). The minimum supported version is Go 1.16.
2. Run `make` from [the repository root](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics). It should build `vmstorage`, `vmselect`
   and `vminsert` binaries and put them into the `bin` folder.


### Building docker images

Run `make package`. It will build the following docker images locally:

* `victoriametrics/vminsert:<PKG_TAG>`
* `victoriametrics/vmselect:<PKG_TAG>`
* `victoriametrics/vmstorage:<PKG_TAG>`

`<PKG_TAG>` is auto-generated image tag, which depends on source code in [the repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics).
The `<PKG_TAG>` may be manually set via `PKG_TAG=foobar make package`.

By default images are built on top of [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) image in order to improve debuggability.
It is possible to build an image on top of any other base image by setting it via `<ROOT_IMAGE>` environment variable.
For example, the following command builds images on top of [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) image:

```bash
ROOT_IMAGE=scratch make package
```

## Operation

## Cluster setup

A minimal cluster must contain the following nodes:

* a single `vmstorage` node with `-retentionPeriod` and `-storageDataPath` flags
* a single `vminsert` node with `-storageNode=<vmstorage_host>:8400`
* a single `vmselect` node with `-storageNode=<vmstorage_host>:8401`

It is recommended to run at least two nodes for each service
for high availability purposes.

An http load balancer such as [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html) or `nginx` must be put in front of `vminsert` and `vmselect` nodes. It must contain the following routing configs according to [the url format](#url-format):
- requests starting with `/insert` must be routed to port `8480` on `vminsert` nodes.
- requests starting with `/select` must be routed to port `8481` on `vmselect` nodes.

Ports may be altered by setting `-httpListenAddr` on the corresponding nodes.

It is recommended setting up [monitoring](#monitoring) for the cluster.

The following tools can simplify cluster setup:
* [An example docker-compose config for VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/cluster/deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml)
* [Helm charts for VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts)
* [Kubernetes operator for VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator)


It is possible manualy setting up a toy cluster on a single host. In this case every cluster component - `vminsert`, `vmselect` and `vmstorage` - must have distinct values for `-httpListenAddr` command-line flag. This flag specifies http address for accepting http requests for [monitoring](#monitoring) and [profiling](#profiling). `vmstorage` node must have distinct values for the following additional command-line flags in order to prevent resource usage clash:
* `-storageDataPath` - every `vmstorage` node must have a dedicated data storage.
* `-vminsertAddr` - every `vmstorage` node must listen for a distinct tcp address for accepting data from `vminsert` nodes.
* `-vmselectAddr` - every `vmstorage` node must listen for a distinct tcp address for accepting requests from `vmselect` nodes.


### Environment variables

Each flag values can be set thru environment variables by following these rules:

- The `-envflag.enable` flag must be set
- Each `.` in flag names must be substituted by `_` (for example `-insert.maxQueueDuration <duration>` will translate to `insert_maxQueueDuration=<duration>`)
- For repeating flags, an alternative syntax can be used by joining the different values into one using `,` as separator (for example `-storageNode <nodeA> -storageNode <nodeB>` will translate to `storageNode=<nodeA>,<nodeB>`)
- It is possible setting prefix for environment vars with `-envflag.prefix`. For instance, if `-envflag.prefix=VM_`, then env vars must be prepended with `VM_`


## Monitoring

All the cluster components expose various metrics in Prometheus-compatible format at `/metrics` page on the TCP port set in `-httpListenAddr` command-line flag.
By default the following TCP ports are used:
- `vminsert` - 8480
- `vmselect` - 8481
- `vmstorage` - 8482

It is recommended setting up [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html)
or Prometheus to scrape `/metrics` pages from all the cluster components, so they can be monitored and analyzed
with [the official Grafana dashboard for VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11176)
or [an alternative dashboard for VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11831).

It is recommended setting up alerts in [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html) or in Prometheus from [this config](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/cluster/deployment/docker/alerts.yml).

* URL for time series deletion: `http://<vmselect>:8481/delete/<accountID>/prometheus/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series?match[]=<timeseries_selector_for_delete>`.
  Note that the `delete_series` handler should be used only in exceptional cases such as deletion of accidentally ingested incorrect time series. It shouldn't
  be used on a regular basis, since it carries non-zero overhead.

* `vmstorage` nodes provide the following HTTP endpoints on `8482` port:
  - `/internal/force_merge` - initiate [forced compactions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#forced-merge) on the given `vmstorage` node.
  - `/snapshot/create` - create [instant snapshot](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282),
    which can be used for backups in background. Snapshots are created in `<storageDataPath>/snapshots` folder, where `<storageDataPath>` is the corresponding
    command-line flag value.
  - `/snapshot/list` - list available snasphots.
  - `/snapshot/delete?snapshot=<id>` - delete the given snapshot.
  - `/snapshot/delete_all` - delete all the snapshots.

  Snapshots may be created independently on each `vmstorage` node. There is no need in synchronizing snapshots' creation
  across `vmstorage` nodes.


## Cluster resizing and scalability

Cluster performance and capacity scales with adding new nodes.

* `vminsert` and `vmselect` nodes are stateless and may be added / removed at any time.
  Do not forget updating the list of these nodes on http load balancer.
  Adding more `vminsert` nodes scales data ingestion rate. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/175#issuecomment-536925841)
  about ingestion rate scalability.
  Adding more `vmselect` nodes scales select queries rate.
* `vmstorage` nodes own the ingested data, so they cannot be removed without data loss.
  Adding more `vmstorage` nodes scales cluster capacity.

Steps to add `vmstorage` node:

1. Start new `vmstorage` node with the same `-retentionPeriod` as existing nodes in the cluster.
2. Gradually restart all the `vmselect` nodes with new `-storageNode` arg containing `<new_vmstorage_host>:8401`.
3. Gradually restart all the `vminsert` nodes with new `-storageNode` arg containing `<new_vmstorage_host>:8400`.


## Updating / reconfiguring cluster nodes

All the node types - `vminsert`, `vmselect` and `vmstorage` - may be updated via graceful shutdown.
Send `SIGINT` signal to the corresponding process, wait until it finishes and then start new version
with new configs.

Cluster should remain in working state if at least a single node of each type remains available during
the update process. See [cluster availability](#cluster-availability) section for details.


## Cluster availability

* HTTP load balancer must stop routing requests to unavailable `vminsert` and `vmselect` nodes.
* The cluster remains available if at least a single `vmstorage` node exists:

  - `vminsert` re-routes incoming data from unavailable `vmstorage` nodes to healthy `vmstorage` nodes
  - `vmselect` continues serving partial responses if at least a single `vmstorage` node is available. If consistency over availability is preferred, then either pass `-search.denyPartialResponse` command-line flag to `vmselect` or pass `deny_partial_response=1` query arg in requests to `vmselect`.

`vmselect` doesn't serve partial responses for API handlers returning raw datapoints - [`/api/v1/export*` endpoints](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-export-time-series), since users usually expect this data is always complete.

Data replication can be used for increasing storage durability. See [these docs](#replication-and-data-safety) for details.


## Capacity planning

VictoriaMetrics uses lower amounts of CPU, RAM and storage space on production workloads compared to competing solutions (Prometheus, Thanos, Cortex, TimescaleDB, InfluxDB, QuestDB, M3DB) according to [our case studies](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CaseStudies.html).

Each node type - `vminsert`, `vmselect` and `vmstorage` - can run on the most suitable hardware. Cluster capacity scales linearly with the available resources. The needed amounts of CPU and RAM per each node type highly depends on the workload - the number of active time series, series churn rate, query types, query qps, etc. It is recommended setting up a test VictoriaMetrics cluster for your production workload and iteratively scaling per-node resources and the number of nodes per node type until the cluster becomes stable. It is recommended setting up [monitoring for the cluster](#monitoring). It helps determining bottlenecks in cluster setup. It is also recommended following [the troubleshooting docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#troubleshooting).

The needed storage space for the given retention (the retention is set via `-retentionPeriod` command-line flag at `vmstorage`) can be extrapolated from disk space usage in a test run. For example, if the storage space usage is 10GB after a day-long test run on a production workload, then it will need at least `10GB*100=1TB` of disk space for `-retentionPeriod=100d` (100-days retention period). Storage space usage can be monitored with [the official Grafana dashboard for VictoriaMetrics cluster](#monitoring).

It is recommended leaving the following amounts of spare resources:

* 50% of free RAM across all the node types for reducing the probability of OOM (out of memory) crashes and slowdowns during temporary spikes in workload.
* 50% of spare CPU across all the node types for reducing the probability of slowdowns during temporary spikes in workload.
* At least 30% of free storage space at the directory pointed by `-storageDataPath` command-line flag at `vmstorage` nodes.

Some capacity planning tips for VictoriaMetrics cluster:

* The [replication](#replication-and-data-safety) increases the amounts of needed resources for the cluster by up to `N` times where `N` is replication factor.
* Cluster capacity for active time series (e.g. time series with recently ingested samples) can be increased by adding more `vmstorage` nodes and/or by increasing RAM and CPU resources per each `vmstorage` node.
* Query latency can be reduced by increasing the number of `vmstorage` nodes and/or by increasing RAM and CPU resources per each `vmselect` node.
* The total number of CPU cores needed for all the `vminsert` nodes can be calculated from the ingestion rate: `CPUs = ingestion_rate / 100K`.
* The `-rpc.disableCompression` command-line flag at `vminsert` nodes can increase ingestion capacity at the cost of higher network bandwidth usage between `vminsert` and `vmstorage`.


## High availability

It is recommended to run all the components for a single cluster in the same subnetwork with high bandwidth, low latency and low error rates.
This improves cluster performance and availability.
It isn't recommended spreading components for a single cluster across multiple availability zones, since cross-AZ network usually has lower bandwidth, higher latency
and higher error rates comparing the network inside AZ.

If you need multi-AZ setup, then it is recommended running independed clusters in each AZ and setting up
[vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html) in front of these clusters, so it could replicate incoming data
into all the cluster. Then [promxy](https://github.com/jacksontj/promxy) could be used for querying the data from multiple clusters.

Another solution is to use multi-level cluster setup, where the top level of `vminsert` nodes [replicate](#replication-and-data-safety) data among the lower level of `vminsert` nodes located at different availability zones. These `vminsert` nodes then spread the data among `vmstorage` nodes in each AZ. See [these docs](#multi-level-cluster-setup) for more details.


## Multi-level cluster setup

`vminsert` nodes can accept data from another `vminsert` nodes starting from [v1.60.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1600) if `-clusternativeListenAddr` command-line flag is set. For example, if `vminsert` is started with `-clusternativeListenAddr=:8400` command-line flag, then it can accept data from another `vminsert` nodes at TCP port 8400 in the same way as `vmstorage` nodes do. This allows chaining `vminsert` nodes and building multi-level cluster topologies with flexible configs. For example, the top level of `vminsert` nodes can replicate data among the second level of `vminsert` nodes located in distinct availability zones (AZ), while the second-level `vminsert` nodes can spread the data among `vmstorage` nodes located in the same AZ. Such setup guarantees cluster availability if some AZ becomes unavailable. The data from all the `vmstorage` nodes in all the AZs can be read via `vmselect` nodes, which are configured to query all the `vmstorage` nodes in all the availability zones (e.g. all the `vmstorage` addresses are passed via `-storageNode` command-line flag to `vmselect` nodes). Additionally, `-replicationFactor=k+1` must be passed to `vmselect` nodes, where `k` is the lowest number of `vmstorage` nodes in a single AZ. See [replication docs](#replication-and-data-safety) for more details.


## Helm

Helm chart simplifies managing cluster version of VictoriaMetrics in Kubernetes.
It is available in the [helm-charts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts) repository.


## Kubernetes operator

[K8s operator](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator) simplifies managing VictoriaMetrics components in Kubernetes.


## Replication and data safety

By default VictoriaMetrics offloads replication to the underlying storage pointed by `-storageDataPath`.

The replication can be enabled by passing `-replicationFactor=N` command-line flag to `vminsert`.
This guarantees that all the data remains available for querying if up to `N-1` `vmstorage` nodes are unavailable.
The cluster must contain at least `2*N-1` `vmstorage` nodes, where `N`
is replication factor, in order to maintain the given replication factor for newly ingested data when `N-1` of storage nodes are lost.
For example, when `-replicationFactor=3` is passed to `vminsert`, then it replicates all the ingested data to 3 distinct `vmstorage` nodes,
so up to 2 `vmstorage` nodes can be lost without data loss. The minimum number of `vmstorage` nodes should be equal to `2*3-1 = 5`, so when 2 `vmstorage` nodes are lost,
the remaining 3 `vmstorage` nodes could provide the `-replicationFactor=3` for newly ingested data.

When the replication is enabled, `-replicationFactor=N` and `-dedup.minScrapeInterval=1ms` command-line flag must be passed to `vmselect` nodes.
The `-replicationFactor=N` improves query performance when up to `N-1` vmstorage nodes respond slowly and/or temporarily unavailable, since `vmselect` doesn't wait for responses from up to `N-1` `vmstorage` nodes. Sometimes `-replicationFactor` at `vmselect` nodes can result in partial responses. See [this issues](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1207) for details.
The `-dedup.minScrapeInterval=1ms` de-duplicates replicated data during queries. If duplicate data is pushed to VictoriaMetrics from identically configured [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html) instances or Prometheus instances, then the `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` must be set to bigger values according to [deduplication docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#deduplication).

Note that [replication doesn't save from disaster](https://medium.com/@valyala/speeding-up-backups-for-big-time-series-databases-533c1a927883),
so it is recommended performing regular backups. See [these docs](#backups) for details.

Note that the replication increases resource usage - CPU, RAM, disk space, network bandwidth - by up to `-replicationFactor` times. So it may be worth
offloading the replication to underlying storage pointed by `-storageDataPath` such as [Google Compute Engine persistent disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/#pdspecs),
which is protected from data loss and data corruption. It also provide consistently high performance
and [may be resized](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk) without downtime.
HDD-based persistent disks should be enough for the majority of use cases.

It is recommended using durable replicated persistent volumes in Kubernetes.


## Backups

It is recommended performing periodical backups from [instant snapshots](https://medium.com/@valyala/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282)
for protecting from user errors such as accidental data deletion.

The following steps must be performed for each `vmstorage` node for creating a backup:

1. Create an instant snapshot by navigating to `/snapshot/create` HTTP handler. It will create snapshot and return its name.
2. Archive the created snapshot from `<-storageDataPath>/snapshots/<snapshot_name>` folder using [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup.html).
   The archival process doesn't interfere with `vmstorage` work, so it may be performed at any suitable time.
3. Delete unused snapshots via `/snapshot/delete?snapshot=<snapshot_name>` or `/snapshot/delete_all` in order to free up occupied storage space.

There is no need in synchronizing backups among all the `vmstorage` nodes.

Restoring from backup:

1. Stop `vmstorage` node with `kill -INT`.
2. Restore data from backup using [vmrestore](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmrestore.html) into `-storageDataPath` directory.
3. Start `vmstorage` node.


## Profiling

All the cluster components provide the following handlers for [profiling](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs):

* `http://vminsert:8480/debug/pprof/heap` for memory profile and `http://vminsert:8480/debug/pprof/profile` for CPU profile
* `http://vmselect:8481/debug/pprof/heap` for memory profile and `http://vmselect:8481/debug/pprof/profile` for CPU profile
* `http://vmstorage:8482/debug/pprof/heap` for memory profile and `http://vmstorage:8482/debug/pprof/profile` for CPU profile

Example command for collecting cpu profile from `vmstorage`:

```bash
curl -s http://vmstorage:8482/debug/pprof/profile > cpu.pprof
```

Example command for collecting memory profile from `vminsert`:

```bash
curl -s http://vminsert:8480/debug/pprof/heap > mem.pprof
```


## Community and contributions

We are open to third-party pull requests provided they follow the [KISS design principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle):

- Prefer simple code and architecture.
- Avoid complex abstractions.
- Avoid magic code and fancy algorithms.
- Avoid [big external dependencies](https://medium.com/@valyala/stripping-dependency-bloat-in-victoriametrics-docker-image-983fb5912b0d).
- Minimize the number of moving parts in the distributed system.
- Avoid automated decisions, which may hurt cluster availability, consistency or performance.

Adhering to the `KISS` principle simplifies the resulting code and architecture, so it can be reviewed, understood and verified by many people.

Due to `KISS`, cluster version of VictoriaMetrics has no the following "features" popular in distributed computing world:

- Fragile gossip protocols. See [failed attempt in Thanos](https://github.com/improbable-eng/thanos/blob/030bc345c12c446962225221795f4973848caab5/docs/proposals/completed/201809_gossip-removal.md).
- Hard-to-understand-and-implement-properly [Paxos protocols](https://www.quora.com/In-distributed-systems-what-is-a-simple-explanation-of-the-Paxos-algorithm).
- Complex replication schemes, which may go nuts in unforeseen edge cases. See [replication docs](#replication-and-data-safety) for details.
- Automatic data reshuffling between storage nodes, which may hurt cluster performance and availability.
- Automatic cluster resizing, which may cost you a lot of money if improperly configured.
- Automatic discovering and addition of new nodes in the cluster, which may mix data between dev and prod clusters :)
- Automatic leader election, which may result in split brain disaster on network errors.

    	Per-second limit on the number of WARN messages. If more than the given number of warns are emitted per second, then the remaining warns are suppressed. Zero values disable the rate limit
  -memory.allowedBytes size
    	Allowed size of system memory VictoriaMetrics caches may occupy. This option overrides -memory.allowedPercent if set to a non-zero value. Too low a value may increase the cache miss rate usually resulting in higher CPU and disk IO usage. Too high a value may evict too much data from OS page cache resulting in higher disk IO usage
    	Supports the following optional suffixes for size values: KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB (default 0)
  -memory.allowedPercent float
    	Allowed percent of system memory VictoriaMetrics caches may occupy. See also -memory.allowedBytes. Too low a value may increase cache miss rate usually resulting in higher CPU and disk IO usage. Too high a value may evict too much data from OS page cache which will result in higher disk IO usage (default 60)
  -precisionBits int
    	The number of precision bits to store per each value. Lower precision bits improves data compression at the cost of precision loss (default 64)
  -retentionPeriod value
    	Data with timestamps outside the retentionPeriod is automatically deleted
    	The following optional suffixes are supported: h (hour), d (day), w (week), y (year). If suffix isn't set, then the duration is counted in months (default 1)
  -rpc.disableCompression
    	Disable compression of RPC traffic. This reduces CPU usage at the cost of higher network bandwidth usage
  -search.maxTagKeys int
    	The maximum number of tag keys returned per search (default 100000)
  -search.maxTagValueSuffixesPerSearch int
    	The maximum number of tag value suffixes returned from /metrics/find (default 100000)
  -search.maxTagValues int
    	The maximum number of tag values returned per search (default 100000)
  -search.maxUniqueTimeseries int
    	The maximum number of unique time series each search can scan (default 300000)
  -smallMergeConcurrency int
    	The maximum number of CPU cores to use for small merges. Default value is used if set to 0
  -snapshotAuthKey string
    	authKey, which must be passed in query string to /snapshot* pages
  -storage.maxDailySeries int
    	The maximum number of unique series can be added to the storage during the last 24 hours. Excess series are logged and dropped. This can be useful for limiting series churn rate. See also -storage.maxHourlySeries
  -storage.maxHourlySeries int
    	The maximum number of unique series can be added to the storage during the last hour. Excess series are logged and dropped. This can be useful for limiting series cardinality. See also -storage.maxDailySeries
  -storageDataPath string
    	Path to storage data (default "vmstorage-data")
  -tls
    	Whether to enable TLS (aka HTTPS) for incoming requests. -tlsCertFile and -tlsKeyFile must be set if -tls is set
  -tlsCertFile string
    	Path to file with TLS certificate. Used only if -tls is set. Prefer ECDSA certs instead of RSA certs as RSA certs are slower
  -tlsKeyFile string
    	Path to file with TLS key. Used only if -tls is set
  -version
    	Show VictoriaMetrics version
  -vminsertAddr string
    	TCP address to accept connections from vminsert services (default ":8400")
  -vmselectAddr string
    	TCP address to accept connections from vmselect services (default ":8401")
```
