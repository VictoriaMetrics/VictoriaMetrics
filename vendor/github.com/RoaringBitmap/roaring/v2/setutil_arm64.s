// This implements union2by2 using golang's version of arm64 assembly
// The algorithm is very similar to the generic one,
// but makes better use of arm64 features so is notably faster.
// The basic algorithm structure is as follows:
// 1. If either set is empty, copy the other set into the buffer and return the length
// 2. Otherwise, load the first element of each set into a variable (s1 and s2).
// 3. a. Compare the values of s1 and s2.
 // b. add the smaller one to the buffer.
 // c. perform a bounds check before incrementing.
 // If one set is finished, copy the rest of the other set over.
 // d. update s1 and or s2 to the next value, continue loop.
 //
 // Past the fact of the algorithm, this code makes use of several arm64 features
 // Condition Codes:
 // arm64's CMP operation sets 4 bits that can be used for branching,
 // rather than just true or false.
 // As a consequence, a single comparison gives enough information to distinguish the three cases
 //
 // Post-increment pointers after load/store:
 // Instructions like `MOVHU.P 2(R0), R6`
 // increment the register by a specified amount, in this example 2.
 // Because uint16's are exactly 2 bytes and the length of the slices
 // is part of the slice header,
 // there is no need to separately track the index into the slice.
 // Instead, the code can calculate the final read value and compare against that,
 // using the post-increment reads to move the pointers along.
 //
 // TODO: CALL out to memmove once the list is exhausted.
 // Right now it moves the necessary shorts so that the remaining count
 // is a multiple of 4 and then copies 64 bits at a time.
