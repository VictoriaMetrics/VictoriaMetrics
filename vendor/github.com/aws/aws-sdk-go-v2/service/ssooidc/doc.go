// Package ssooidc provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// SSO OIDC.
//
// AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables a
// client (such as AWS CLI or a native application) to register with AWS SSO. The
// service also enables the client to fetch the userâ€™s access token upon successful
// authentication and authorization with AWS SSO. This service conforms with the
// OAuth 2.0 based implementation of the device authorization grant standard
// (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628)). For
// general information about AWS SSO, see What is AWS Single Sign-On?
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) in the
// AWS SSO User Guide. This API reference guide describes the AWS SSO OIDC
// operations that you can call programatically and includes detailed information
// on data types and errors. AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample
// code for various programming languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .Net,
// iOS, and Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic
// access to AWS SSO and other AWS services. For more information about the AWS
// SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web
// Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
